abstract={The question of what should be meant by a measurement is tackled from a mathematical perspective whose physical interpretation is that a measurement is a fundamental process via which a finite amount of classical information is produced. This translates into an algebraic and topological definition of measurement space that caters for the distinction between quantum and classical measurements and allows a notion of observer to be derived.},
