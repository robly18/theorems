Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2021,
 I set up a Wordpress blog on my undergraduate webpage with the intent to post math content there.
 I didn't write more than three or four posts.
 One of these posts,
 however,
 I considered to be quite good content,
 even if it was blatantly unfinished.
 Meanwhile,
 some software update or incompatibility has taken the original blog down.
 I've been able to obtain a copy of my post from the Internet Archive.
 For safekeeping,
 this document is a direct transcription of this post (and a prerequisite post) to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 form,
 with all the blemishes and issues of the original format.
 It is my hope to one day make a more refined document,
 but odds are I'll put it off for a few more years yet.

This post talks about visualization of the dual space 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To read it,
 you need to know what a vector space is.
 If you don’t,
 this post is not for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This post is loosely based on the excellent book Geometrical Vectors by Gabriel Weinreich,
 which is about visualization of vectors and covectors,
 as well as On the Visualisation of Differential Forms by Dan Piponi,
 which is a random PDF I found online but thought was great.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our experience,
 a vector is an arrow,
 pointing from the origin to some point.
 Of course,
 the fact that it starts at the origin is just convention of notation on our part:
 we could “place the vector anywhere”,
 as long as it points in the same direction and has the same length.
 If we transform our space in some way,
 the vector is transformed in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me elaborate on that last sentence for a moment.
 Let us imagine that I have a map of my bedroom,
 in which I have outlined the position of the chair I am writing this on,
 as well as my bed pillow,
 represented below as 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Let us suppose that the scale of the map is in meters (this is important!) Represented below is also the vector going from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 which we will henceforth call 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

.

Now,
 let us suppose that I decide to draw this map,
 but change the scale of the map.
 For example,
 suppose I scale the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis by a half,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is now measured in 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times\meter$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 everything in the map gets scaled,
 including the vector:

 A 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $1\meter$
\end_inset

,
 and an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 tick is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\meter$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
 Pay attention to the difference between the map and the territory.
 I only rescaled the map:
 my actual bedroom has not been compressed.
 The coordinates of the points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B'$
\end_inset

 correspond to coordinates on the page,
 not in real life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 to be perfectly rigorous,
 every time I make a rescaled map I should be giving a new name to the points.
 However,
 I would end up with something like 
\begin_inset Formula $A''''$
\end_inset

 in no time,
 so I'll just stop worrying about it.
 Just keep in mind that in each map I'm considering different points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyhow,
 I could keep doing transformations on this map,
 but nothing would be surprising.
 If I rotate the axes,
 or pick a different basis,
 the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 will always point from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 as it should.
 The trickiness starts when I consider some kind of vector that does not represent a displacement between two points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the simplest possible examples is a slope vector.
 Suppose I set up a straight ramp,
 so that I can roll marbles from my head down to my pillow.
 I can represent the slope of this ramp by a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{s}$
\end_inset

,
 which points in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

downhill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction,
 and whose magnitude is the slope (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z/\Delta\ell$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is the height and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is how far along the ramp I am).
 For example,
 if my ramp decreased a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{2}+2^{2}=13$
\end_inset

 meters (I have a very tall room),
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{s}$
\end_inset

 would be pointing in the 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 direction and have magnitude 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3^{2}+2^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Schematically,
 we get a familiar looking picture.

\begin_layout Standard
[If you're thinking about 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 as minus the gradient of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x,y)$
\end_inset

,
 you're not too far off,
 but hold your horses for the moment.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What can I do,
 and what do I want to do,
 with this 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 vector?
 I can use it to calculate the force a ball feels when placed on the ramp,
 or the vector (in 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{3}$
\end_inset

) orthogonal to the ramp,
 but both of these are specific cases of something more general:
 we want to recover the shape of the ramp from the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be more specific,
 we want to solve the following problem:
 Given the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 vector,
 which encodes the direction and slope of the ramp,
 we want to recover the function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x,y)$
\end_inset

,
 which given a point 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

 returns the height of the ramp at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
 Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 vector only gives us information about the slope,
 we cannot expect to fully determine 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 we will establish that at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 the ramp is at a known height 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore,
 in order not to worry about the domain of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

,
 let us assume that the ramp has been extended to cover the whole space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution to our problem is not particularly difficult.
 The graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a plane,
 so 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 must be of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(x,y)=ax+by+c.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $h(A)$
\end_inset

 is known to be 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}$
\end_inset

,
 we can write this in a more convenient manner
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(p)=(a,b)\cdot(p-A)+h_{0}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,b)$
\end_inset

,
 recall first that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,b)$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to level sets.
 Looking at the figure above,
 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is also orthogonal to level sets (this is in fact what we meant when we said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 points in the downhill direction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

),
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,b)=\alpha s$
\end_inset

 for some real number 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To discover 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

,
 we can use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $h(B)$
\end_inset

 is known,
 plugging 
\begin_inset Formula $h(B)=h_{0}-13$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha s\cdot(B-A)=-13.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $s=B-A$
\end_inset

 in our coordinate system and 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm{B-A}=\sqrt{13}$
\end_inset

,
 we conclude 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=-1$
\end_inset

,
 hence
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(p)=h_{0}-s\cdot(p-A).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slightly more generally,
 it is a trivial exercise to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $h(p)-h(q)=-s\cdot(p-q)$
\end_inset

,
 so in some sense,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 vector serves as a ruler which which one can measure height differences.
 This is,
 in fact,
 an apt way to think about 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

,
 and the way we are thinking about 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

,
 is very closely related to the euclidean inner product.
 The inner product has an important property:
 while it behaves well under isometries,
 it gets distorted under other changes of coordinates.
 For example,
 if we rescale the whole map by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 along with it,
 the above formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $h(p)$
\end_inset

 ceases to work.
 For example,
 
\begin_inset Formula $h(B)$
\end_inset

 (recall that in rigour I should be writing 
\begin_inset Formula $B'$
\end_inset

) is meant to be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}-13$
\end_inset

,
 but if 
\begin_inset Formula $s'$
\end_inset

 is the rescaled vector we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{0}-(B-A)\cdot s'=h_{0}-(1.5,1)\cdot(1.5,1)=h_{0}-\frac{13}{4}\neq h_{0}-13.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see,
 this yields the wrong result.
 As it should,
 of course:
 if we scaled both 
\begin_inset Formula $(B-A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

,
 the term 
\begin_inset Formula $(B-A)\cdot s$
\end_inset

 will have gotten smaller by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

.
 The obvious way to fix the problem would,
 in fact,
 be to scale 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 up by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

,
 while everything else got scaled down by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We can see this same phenomenon in other changes of variable.
 For example,
 suppose we scaled only the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis in the original map,
 so the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis is measured in 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times m$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 We represent below the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

naïvely scaled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $s'$
\end_inset

,
 as well as a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 which has been scaled the opposite way:
 that is,
 its 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 coordinate was doubled instead of halved.

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the image,
 it is not immediately obvious why 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the way we want 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 to scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 After all,
 it's pointing in a completely different direction.
 However,
 it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the right vector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to ensure that the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 doesn't change:
 otherwise,
 we'd need to change the inner product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scaling differently
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is at the heart of the idea of a covector.
 It is kind of like a vector,
 but it behaves very differently under changes of coordinates.
 And this change is made in order to retain a very specific aspect:
 if the vectors of the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are scaled in some manner,
 the covectors are scaled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inversely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in order to preserve inner products between vectors and covectors!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this manner,
 the role of covectors is to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

be inner product'd with vectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In some sense,
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most natural setting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the scalar product of two vectors is actually between a vector and a covector,
 because it becomes independent of our coordinate system.
 The way we scale covectors relative to vectors will ensure that the scalar product is independent of the chosen basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then,
 the notion of scalar product becomes somewhat superfluous.
 If all we're going to do with covectors is to use them to obtain numbers from vectors (and add covectors to each other and stuff),
 we might as well define a covector as a thing that turns vectors into numbers.
 But this is precisely the notion of dual vector:
 that is,
 an element of the dual space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall the definition of dual space:
 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the set of linear functions from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\R$
\end_inset

 (or whatever field the vector space is over).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion:
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is a vector space,
 we use the name vector for elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

,
 and covectors for elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How it fits together
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now recall elementary linear algebra to figure out how to make sense of the relation between this notion of covector and the scaling properties mentioned before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all,
 how to represent a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in coordinates?
 Since a covector is a different kind of object from a vector,
 fixing a basis of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},\dots,e_{n}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 does not allow us to represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in as a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two distinct but equivalent ways to handle the subject matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Dual Basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset FormulaMacro
\newcommand{\braket}[1]{}
{\langle#1\rangle}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the simplest way.
 Given a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},\dots,e_{n}$
\end_inset

,
 we define the so-called dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{1},\dots,\omega^{n}$
\end_inset

 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega^{i}(e_{j})=\delta_{ij},\text{ or equivalently }\omega^{i}(\sum_{j}x_{j}e_{j})=x_{i}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then,
 any covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 can be written as a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{i}$
\end_inset

,
 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda(x)=\lambda\left(\sum x_{i}e_{i}\right)=\lambda\left(\sum\omega^{i}(x)e_{i}\right)=\sum\lambda(e_{i})\omega^{i}(x),
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
whence 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\sum\lambda(e_{i})\omega^{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 we can consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th coordinate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in some basis as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 applied to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th vector of this basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bonus:
 Compare the following three formulas to write a vector or a covector in coordinates.
 The first is the usual formula for the coordinates of a vector in orthonormal coordinates (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

Matrix Form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This form is slightly more enlightening,
 because as well as telling us what the coordinates are,
 it also tells us how they should be organized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall from linear algebra that when we record the coordinates of a vector in some basis we do so in column-matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall also that given a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T\colon V\to W$
\end_inset

,
 a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

,
 we record the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coordinates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in a matrix.
 This matrix is of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim W\times\dim V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it turns out,
 the convention of writing vectors as column-matrices can be seen as a particular case of this process:
 to specify an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is the same as to specify a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\R\to W$
\end_inset

,
 yielding a matrix of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\dim W\times1$
\end_inset

.
 It stands to reason that a dual vector,
 which is a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $V\to\R$
\end_inset

,
 should be represented as a vector of size 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times\dim V$
\end_inset

;
 in other words,
 a row-vector!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should the coordinates be?
 In this,
 we find the same answer as before (which is why the two points of view are equivalent).
 Recall from linear algebra that in order to represent 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 as a matrix,
 one must first specify a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{v_{k}\}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{w_{k}\}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

,
 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $ij$
\end_inset

-th element of said matrix is the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th coordinate (in 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

) of 
\begin_inset Formula $Tv_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In our case,
 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\R$
\end_inset

,
 and the most natural basis is the single vector 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

,
 and so we conclude that (given a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},\dots,e_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

) it is natural to represent a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in coordinates as the row-matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}\lambda(e_{1}) & \dots & \lambda(e_{n})\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This representation has two benefits.
 One,
 it reminds us that vectors and covectors are fundamentally different objects,
 which could be lost on us if we represented both as mere sequences of numbers.
 Two,
 it leads to a nice identity for application of covectors in local coordinates.
 Given a vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

,
 some basis,
 a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

,
 let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 be their coordinate representations.
 Then,
 the following identity holds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda(v)=\hat{\lambda}\hat{v}.
\]

\end_inset

To conclude this section and move on to more visual stuff,
 let us discuss how covectors (or rather,
 their representations) change under changes of basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},\dots,e_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1},\dots,f_{n}$
\end_inset

 be two different bases of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

,
 denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{e}$
\end_inset

 the coordinates of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 basis,
 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 be the matrix whose 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th column is the coordinates of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{j}$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 basis.
 Then,
 linear algebra relates the representation of a vector in both bases by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{e}=Bv_{f}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does it relate the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{e}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{f}$
\end_inset

?
 From the identities we have already deduced,
 we conclude
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{f}=\begin{bmatrix}\lambda(f_{1}) & \dots & \lambda(f_{n})\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\lambda_{e}(f_{1})_{e} & \dots & \lambda_{e}(f_{n})_{e}\end{bmatrix},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and from a little bit of matrix block multiplication we reach the conclusion
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{f}=\lambda_{e}\begin{bmatrix}(f_{1})_{e} & \dots & (f_{n})_{e}\end{bmatrix}=\lambda_{e}B.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compare the two formulas:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{e}=Bv_{f},\quad\lambda_{e}=\lambda_{f}B^{-1}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formulas are identical,
 except that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 has been sent to the other side and inverted.
 This is as it should be,
 as it ensures that the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(v)=\lambda_{e}v_{e}$
\end_inset

 holds in any basis,
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{e}v_{e}=\lambda_{f}B^{-1}Bv_{f}=\lambda_{f}v_{f}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last argument can be used as a mnemonic in a pinch to deduce how coordinates of covectors ought to change in order to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preserve the dot product
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that we are representing the coordinates of the covector as a row-matrix.
 Note how,
 if we represented them in a column-matrix,
 the formulas would become slightly more awkward.
 The coordinates represented in a column-matrix are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{e})^{\tr}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{f})^{\tr}$
\end_inset

,
 and so we conclude
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\lambda_{e})^{\tr}=(B^{-1})^{\tr}(\lambda_{f})^{\tr},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in other words,
 if the vector coordinates have changed by 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 then the covector coordinates have changed by 
\begin_inset Formula $(B^{-1})^{\tr}$
\end_inset

All this discussion is fine and all,
 but it doesn't help us

 covectors.
 I don't know about you,
 but I have a hard time imagining covectors as arrows which 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

just scale differently
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 For one,
 using equal-looking arrows to represent two distinct kinds of vectors is inconvenient,
 and visualizing how they change upon distortion of the space is troublesome.
 Fortunately,
 this is only because arrows are the wrong tool for the job:
 there's another,
 more convenient way to represent covectors visually.

To visualize how our covector changes we need to find its new direction and the new magnitude.
 Let's focus on direction first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the original coordinates,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 pointed straight from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 but upon coordinate change that stopped happening,
 so 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the usual sense is not reliable.
 However,
 if you'll look closely,
 you'll find something that hasn't changed when we changed coordinates:
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to the level sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests a relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 (or rather,
 its representation) and these level sets.
 In retrospect,
 this shouldn't be surprising:
 recall that we originally defined 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 as a vector that represents the slope of my ramp (or,
 more abstractly,
 of a plane).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The connection goes a little bit deeper,
 however.
 Recall:
 What do we do with covectors?
 The answer:
 apply them to a vector to get a number.
 And while the inner product of vectors has an okay geometrical interpretation (project one vector onto the other and take the product of lengths),
 the product of a vector with a covector can be even more visual.
 For example,
 let us create a point 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 about a third of the way down the ramp,
 and let us calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $h(C)$
\end_inset

 using the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $h(p)=h_{0}-s\cdot(p-A)$
\end_inset

,
 or,
 as we should be writing it if we're seeing 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 as a covector,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(p)=h_{0}-s(p-A).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $h(C)$
\end_inset

.
 One of them is simply calculating:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(C)=h_{0}-(3,2)\cdot(1,1)=h_{0}-5.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another is to look at the level sets.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{AC}$
\end_inset

 intersects five level sets (not counting the one at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

),
 and so we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has decreased by 5 steps on the way from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In other words,
 given a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 we can calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $s(v)$
\end_inset

 by inspecting how many level sets 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 passes through.
 This shouldn't be surprising:
 after all,
 by definition these level sets measure the change in 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests a change in perspective:
 instead of visualizing a covector as an arrow,
 it is best to visualize it as the collection of its level sets.
 In our two-dimensional case,
 we visualize 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 as a collection of parallel lines.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional space,
 we can imagine a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 as a collection of hyperplanes.
 To evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(v)$
\end_inset

,
 one counts how many of these hyperplanes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 the arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 crosses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few loose ends which still need to be tied up.
 First of all,
 to specify the level sets isn't enough:
 one needs to specify in which direction the numbers get bigger.
 But that's just a matter of specifying an orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second:
 The interpretation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

applying a covector to a vector is just counting intersections
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is pretty cool,
 but comes with a lot of asterisks.
 If you only draw the level sets corresponding to the integers,
 you don't have enough resolution for non-integral results;
 you can't have,
 say,
 3.5 intersections between a vector and a collection of hyperplanes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix this last problem we change our perspective.
 Instead of drawing a discrete collection of hyperplanes,
 imagine infinitely many,
 with an infinitesimal distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 between each of them.
 In order to evaluate the covector on a vector,
 we count how many planes the vector crosses,
 with the caveat that each plane counts only 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

,
 where this is another infinitesimal number.
 This isn't a rigorous visualization,
 of course;
 there's no such thing as infinitesimal (real) numbers.
 But if we play a bit loose with rules,
 it works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's how the visualization works under transformations.
 If we distort space,
 every hyperplane still counts for 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

,
 but the hyperplanes themselves are rotated or squished together or torn apart.
 Since they represent level sets of the covector,
 they will always remain a faithful representation of it,
 and we will always be able to imagine evaluating the covector on a vector as counting the number of planes it intersects (times 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 in practical terms,
 we will only draw a few of these hyperplanes,
 leaving the job of picturing the infinity of them with tiny spaces between them to the reader.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have determined that,
 when measuring slopes in a coordinate-independent way,
 the notion of covector is more robust with regard to coordinate changes than a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A covector can be defined as a linear transformation from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\R$
\end_inset

.
 This makes sense intuitively (because to measure a slope is to assign a height to each number) and formally (because the coordinates scale as we want them to).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can visualize such covectors,
 not as arrows,
 but as stacked (oriented) hyperplanes,
 an infinity of them an infinitesimal distance from each other.
 Under this picture,
 evaluation of a covector on a vector amounts to counting how many hyperplanes the vector crosses.

Motivation (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before defining the notion of differential form,
 it is first useful to consider what problem we intend to solve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem at hand is that of integration.
 We already know how to differentiate maps between differential manifolds,
 and now we wish to find out how to integrate them.
 Unfortunately,
 by itself this is not possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example,
 consider the constant function equal to one on the unit sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Its integral really ought to be the surface area of the sphere,
 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 the unit sphere is diffeomorphic,
 and therefore indistinguishable as a smooth manifold,
 from the radius two sphere,
 which we will call 
\begin_inset Formula $2S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 But integrating 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 on the latter yields a different result:
 
\begin_inset Formula $16\pi$
\end_inset

.
 What gives?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obvious answer is that we shouldn't be integrating the 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 function,
 but rather the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4},$
\end_inset

 because the diffeomorphism between 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2S^{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spreads out the function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And while this is legitimate intuition,
 that's just not how functions 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

go across diffeomorphisms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We need to consider some other kind of object.

\begin_layout Standard
Let's inspect the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physicist's way
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of approaching integration.
 First,
 one divides the domain of discourse into many small rectangles,
 whose area we know how to calculate.
 Then,
 for each square,
 one multiplies the value of on that rectangle by its area .
 Finally,
 one sums over all the tiny squares,
 which we represent by a tall S in a familiar way as 
\begin_inset Formula $\int f\,\dl A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fail on smooth manifolds?
 The problem is that we don't know how to measure the areas of the tiny rectangles.
 Indeed,
 the notion of area is not conserved when we change charts,
 so we cannot simply 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure the area of the rectangle in coordinates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 because this area depends on the coordinates chosen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently,
 in order to define integration,
 we need to add additional structure.
 For each point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in our manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

,
 we need to know how to measure areas of tiny rectangles in a coordinate-free way.
 The apparatus that allows us to do so is precisely the differential form:
 it receives an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimal parallelogram
\begin_inset Quotes erd

The relation between a parallelogram (orange) and the tangent vectors that represent it.
 Since our parallelogram is infinitesimal,
 we work not with its edge-vectors,

\begin_inset Formula $1/\varepsilon$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd

 where

This,
 by itself,
 is enough motivation to define a differential form as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

something that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 tangent vectors and returns a number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 and it is very natural to require multilinearity and skew-symmetry.
 However,
 we have not yet reached a useful visualization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To proceed,
 let us imagine that our manifold is some kind of physical object,
 composed of many tiny pieces like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 there is an unambiguous way to measure some kind of area on the manifold:
 given some shape,
 one can count how many atoms lie in this shape.
 Then,
 assuming the atoms are uniformly distributed in some sense,
 one must only multiply the atom count by some scaling factor to obtain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thought experiment shows that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manifold made of atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has a canonical way of measuring area (modulo a scaling factor).
 Therefore,
 it might be worth toying with the idea of representing a differential form by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a cover of the manifold by atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then make the following 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

definition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
 a differential form on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is a cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 by an infinitely dense mesh of points.
 To calculate the area of a set 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq M$
\end_inset

,
 we count the number of atoms in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

,
 and multiply by an appropriate infinitesimal number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest benefit of this point of view is that it behaves naturally with regard to rescalings.
 In other words,
 if we apply a diffeomorphism to the manifold that scales everything up in some manner,
 we are also scaling up the spaces between the atoms (but not the weight of the atoms themselves!).
 Therefore,
 area is conserved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalently,
 this point of view allows for coordinate-independent measurement of area,
 as any distortion between two charts of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 will imply an equal distortion of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 and again area is conserved.

 what comes next?
 Why are other dimension forms necessary?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the most elementary level,
 forms of dimensions other than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 appear in the statement of the generalized Stokes theorem (we will henceforth drop the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the name).
 This is an important theorem,
 having as particular cases the divergence and Green's theorem,
 which are very useful tools of calculation.
 Therefore,
 I hope the reader will agree that the study and proof (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proof
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of this theorem is a worthwhile endeavor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the reader is not yet familiar with the Stokes theorem,
 they may have some trouble understanding the following few paragraphs.
 However,
 I hope that the subject matter will become clearer over time.
 In any case,
 I suggest that such a reader would continue linearly until we state and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

prove
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the Stokes theorem,
 and then return here and reread this part with more context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statement of the Stokes theorem relates the integral of a form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 on the border of a set 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 with the integral of its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl\omega$
\end_inset

 on the interior of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

,
 with the usual statement being cleanly written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{\partial U}\omega=\int_{U}\dl\omega.
\]

\end_inset

Setting aside for now the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 part of the statement,
 there is something we first have to touch.
 What kind of object does 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 have to be for us to integrate it on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial U$
\end_inset

?
 It cannot be a differential form as we have described them,
 because if we fill the space with a very fine grid of atoms,
 it is very unlikely that any of them lie exactly on the border of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$

In other words,
 we seek to solve the following problem.
 We have already concluded that the kind of object used to integrate over 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional area is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 However,
 this is not adequate to integrate over 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}

\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $M$

 Therefore,
 we wish to discover what kind of object will allow us to naturally define integrals on 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algebraic point of view presents itself rather naturally.
 Recall that the algebraic definition of a differential form is a thing that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 tangent vectors to the same point and returns a number.
 We want to define an object on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 which can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

restricted to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 becoming an object which takes 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vectors tangent to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and returns a number.
 It is then natural to define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as an object which takes 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 tangent vectors at the same point of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

,
 and the restriction to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 becomes simply the restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 to the collection of vectors tangent to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now go from the algebraic point of view to the pictorial one.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form receives 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vectors,
 forming the edges of an infinitesimal parallelogram of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 For example,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

,
 this means that we are considering an infinitesimal line segment or rectangle,
 instead of a cube.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've seen my other post on the dual space,
 you should already be familiar with a way to visualize a covector,
 a thing that receives a vector and returns a number,
 as a collection of hyperplanes.
 This carries over to the notion of 1-form,
 which is also a thing that recieves a vector and returns a number.
 Indeed,
 we can visualize a 1-form as a collection of hypersurfaces (surfaces of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

) on our manifold,
 and evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 on a vector consists of counting how many of these hypersurfaces intersect the given vector.
 Note the similarities:

 this means that these intersections will often be

\shape default
 Why would this statement be true,
 and what do we mean by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer is related to a concept known in differential geometry as transversality.
 The following discussion comes with a lot of asterisks,
 and is even more handwavey than the rest of this post.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two submanifolds 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 of a common manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 are said to intersect transversely at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}B$
\end_inset

 span 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}M$
\end_inset

.
 Intuitively,
 this corresponds to the intersection being,
 well,
 transversal,
 as opposed to tangent.
 For example,
 two curves in the plane intersect transversely at a point if they form an angle which is not 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $180$
\end_inset

 degrees.
 Two curves in space never intersect transversely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important fact about transversality,
 aside from the fact that transverse intersections are The Nice Kind,
 is that it is robust and very common.
 By this we mean that if two manifolds intersect transversely,
 then small enough perturbations of the manifolds will not mess that up:
 given small enough perturbations,
 they will still intersect,
 and the intersection will still be transverse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 non-transversality is sensitive and rare.
 If two manifolds intersect non-transversely,
 then almost no perturbations will preserve this state of affairs.
 For example,
 consider two lines in space.
 If you perturb either of them randomly,
 it is almost certain that they will stop intersecting.
 As another example,
 consider in 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{2}$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis and the graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=x^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 These curves intersect non-transversely at the origin,
 but any tiny nudge in either of these curves in the up or down direction will make the intersection transverse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 transverse intersections satisfy the dimensionality property referred at the start.
 That is,
 if two manifolds 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 respectively,
 intersect transversely,
 their intersection is a manifold of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b-n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence,
 we will henceforth (as we have thus far) ignore the possibility of nontransverse intersections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Orientations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important detail to be observed is the orientation of the surfaces 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and more specifically the orientation of the intersections.

 Then,
 the

 the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl y$

,
 which is represented as a uniform stack of horizontal lines.
 The mnemonic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\dl y(v)$
\end_inset

 is to count how many horizontal lines 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

 works if

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest solution is to play with orientability.
 Suppose,
 for the moment,
 that

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 we represent it visually by a mesh of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Points will be represented,

 as either red or blue depending on whether they are positively or negatively oriented.
 (Yes,
 a zero dimensional manifold has orientation,
 either positive or negative at each point!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Curves will be represented with an arrow representing the positive direction.
 The sign convention for evaluation will be given by the right-hand rule,
 so for example 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl y$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be given by arrows pointing to the right,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x\wedge\dl y$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{3}$
\end_inset

 would be given by arrows pointing upwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When representing 1-forms in

 it should be understood which normal direction is positive,
 either via arrows indicating the positive direction or through written indication.
 However,
 this case probably won't happen a lot.

 As is known,
 zero-forms coincide with functions on the manifold.
 The function

Again,
 note that all of this makes sense for orientable 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 In one hand,
 this foreshadows an interesting fact:
 the theory of forms is more well-behaved for orientable manifolds than non-orientable ones.
 For example,
 a Riemannian metric on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 induces a volume form if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is orientable;
 in fact,
 a differentiable manifold is orientable if and only if it admits an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form which is never null.
 Finally,
 and most problematic,
 the definition of integral of an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form on a manifold requires that the manifold be orientable,
 so without orientability everything we intend to do with forms breaks down.
 [Note:
 There is a way around this last problem called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

densities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 which is a sort of generalization of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms.
 Unfortunately,
 I know nothing about it.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand,
 I would like to point out that despite these problems,
 a lot of what we will do works equally well in non-orientable surfaces.
 Indeed,
 every manifold is locally orientable,
 so our pictures work locally,
 and non-orientability will not invalidate our discussions on the exterior derivative,
 wedges or Lie derivatives.
 As a rule of thumb,
 local or pointwise statements will work in every manifold,
 while global statements require orientability.

All this to say,
 our formalism does not require that the surfaces representing forms be boundaryless.
 Indeed,
 some forms,
 like 
\begin_inset Formula $x\,\dl y$
\end_inset

,
 require that the surfaces representing them have boundary.
 As a consequence,
 it is natural to ask,
 given a form,
 whats its boundary is.
 You can probably see where this is going:
 if the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is represented by a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)$

 their boundaries (which are 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k-1)$
\end_inset

-forms) make up a

\begin_inset Formula $\dl\omega$

 The forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\,\dl y$

 are represented without boundary,
 so their exterior derivatives are null,
 which agrees with the symbolic computation.
 On the other hand,
 if we look at the borders of 
\begin_inset Formula $x\,\dl y$
\end_inset

 we get a uniform mesh of points,
 also known as the familiar 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x\wedge\dl y$

 so that near the axes there are less planes,

 Furthermore,
 the amount of planes at a point is proportional to

\end_inset

 component is trivial:
 it is simply the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 component of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 To compute 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}$
\end_inset

,
 it is convenient to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}$
\end_inset

 can be easily written as 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}=a\cdot v_{3}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since it is tangent to horizontal curves,
 it is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(v_{2x},v_{2y},0)$
\end_inset

.
 Since it is tangent to the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $xy=c$
\end_inset

,
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p+\varepsilon v_{2}$
\end_inset

 ought to be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}y_{0}$
\end_inset

 to first order.
 This value is 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{0}+\varepsilon v_{2x})(y_{0}+\varepsilon v_{2y})\approx x_{0}y_{0}+\varepsilon(x_{0}v_{2y}+y_{0}v_{2x})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,we conclude
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{0}v_{2y}+y_{0}x_{2x}=0.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unit norm solution to this equation with,
 say,
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2x}>0$

 is
\begin_inset Formula

v_{2}=\frac{1}{r}(x_{0},-y_{0},0),\quad\text{with }r=\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 we calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

 as a unit vector,
 pointing away from the axes,
 orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Orthogonality to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 means simply its last coordinate is null,
 so we get 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}=(v_{3x},v_{3y},0)$
\end_inset

.
 Orthogonality to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}v_{3x}-y_{0}v_{3y}=0$
\end_inset

,
 with obvious solution
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{3}=\frac{1}{r}(y_{0},x_{0},0).

In conclusion,
 we may write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega(a,b)=\left|\begin{array}{cc}

\frac{1}{r}(y_{0}a_{x}+x_{0}a_{y}) & \frac{1}{r}(y_{0}b_{x}+x_{0}b_{y})

\begin_layout Standard
or,
 in more familiar wedge notation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=\omega(v_{1},v_{3})\,\dl z\wedge\left(\frac{1}{r}(y_{0}\,\dl x+x_{0}\,\dl y)\right)=\frac{1}{r}\omega(v_{3},v_{1})(y_{0}\,\dl x\wedge\dl z+x_{0}\,\dl y\wedge\dl z).

(Note the double sign change in the second step!
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(v_{1},v_{3})\to\omega(v_{3},v_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl z\wedge\dl x\to\dl x\wedge\dl z$
\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 we calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(v_{3},v_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 The order change may appear confusing (we put 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

 before 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

),
 but it is actually for the best:
 this way,
 the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

,
 and the red arrows satisfy the right-hand rule,
 so that the result is positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a vertical unit vector and the system is symmetric with regard to vertical translations,
 we reduce the computation to finding out how many curves the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{3}$
\end_inset

 passes through in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{0}$
\end_inset

 plane.
 In other words,
 we wish to find out how much 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 varies between 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p+\varepsilon v_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The answer is trivial to calculate:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{\text{final}}=(x_{0}+\varepsilon\frac{1}{r}y_{0})(y_{0}+\varepsilon\tfrac{1}{r}x_{0})\approx c_{\text{start}}+\varepsilon\frac{1}{r}(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2})=c_{\text{start}}+\varepsilon r.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore,
 we conclude that the rectangle spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon v_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon v_{1}$
\end_inset

 passes through roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}r$
\end_inset

 curves,
 whence 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(v_{3},v_{1})$
\end_inset

 should be 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

,
 and so our sketches yield
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=y\,\dl x\wedge\dl z+x\,\dl y\wedge\dl z.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was a boatload of work.
 Good thing they invented vector calculus,
 with which we may verify our computation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=\dl(xy\,\dl z)=\dl(xy)\wedge\dl z=(y\,\dl x+x\dl y)\wedge\dl z=y\,\dl x\wedge\dl z+x\,\dl y\wedge\dl z.

an outside

 The

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be small in the sense that a line cannot 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

go on infinitely inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For example,
 the plane 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 would not split 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{3}$
\end_inset

 into an inside and an outside,
 because neither half-space is small in this sense:
 you have infinite line segments living in each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a set we wish to consider is 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=S^{2}$
\end_inset

,
 which splits 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{3}$
\end_inset

 into an inside and an outside.
 The inside is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the only way to have an infinite line inside 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is to have it wind up infinitely.
 Now,
 it is hard to express properly why such infinite winding up is disallowed,
 but if we assume that it is,
 then the inside of 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 counts as small.
 We are interested in sets whose inside satisfies this property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course,
 all this intuitive handwaving is intended to convey a concept which mathematicians have figured out long ago:
 We want 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 to be the border of a manifold with boundary,
 say 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 To say that 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is small is to say that 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is compact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 we intend to integrate some 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Ordinarily,
 there would be no reason to believe that there would be a way to simplify this computation,
 but the hypothesis that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 splits the space in two implies a very important fact:
 
\emph on
any line which enters 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 must either exit it again or stop inside 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 if we see integrating an 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

-form on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 as counting the lines entering 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

,
 we conclude that solving the problem of integrating 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the same as to count the number of line ends in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 The line ends are counted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl\omega$
\end_inset

,
 and so we conclude the familiar formula
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{\partial N}\omega=\int_{N}\dl\omega.

\begin_layout Subsection
What Comes Next
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's recap what we've done thus far.
 We have defined an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form as an area/volume/measure measuring device.
 In order to measure areas of lower dimension (say,
 on submanifolds) we have defined the notion of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

.
 These lower-dimensional forms displayed a phenomenon that could not be seen in the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms,
 which is the possibility that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were manifolds with boundary.
 Hence,
 we defined the notion of exterior derivative as that which recovers these boundaries,
 and turns a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form into a 
\begin_inset Formula $(k+1)$
\end_inset

-form.
 Finally,
 we exploited the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closed surface
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to simplify the computation of integrals of 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

-forms,
 by noticing that counting outbound lines is the same as counting line ends inside the surface.
 This is the celebrated Stokes Theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Stokes Theorem is certainly a very important milestone in vector calculus,
 but it is only the beginning.
 I cannot hope to describe every phenomenon and definition,
 but in the remainder of this post we will look at four important concepts:
 Wedge Products,
 Pullbacks,
 Lie Derivatives and Inner Products (aka Contraction aka that thing where you put a vector field into the form).
 The discussion will culminate in another celebrated formula of tensor calculus:

\begin_layout Subsection
The Wedge Product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Introduction:
 Wedges as Symbolic Glue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the biggest advantages of tensor calculus is its practicality.
 With only a small set of rules,
 it is possible to do all kinds of manipulations and calculations in coordinates,
 which is part of what makes tensors so useful and applicable in engineering and physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason behind this practicality is that,
 as the reader may or may not already know,
 tensors are decomposible into very elementary parts.
 Indeed,
 any tensor can be written using only functions and one-forms,
 for example something of the sort
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=f\,\dl x\wedge\dl y+g\,\dl z\wedge\dl w.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symbol between the one-forms is called the wedge product,
 and it is the glue that allows us to compose small-dimensional forms in order to make higher-dimensional forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore,
 when we define some new type of transformation (like,
 say,
 an exterior derivative or a Lie derivative),
 it suffices to find how it behaves on these elementary parts,
 and how it behaves under the wedge product.
 This then gives us a recipe for computing that transformation:
 simply decompose,
 apply to the elementary parts,
 and tie it all back again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Remark:
 The reader might (understandably) believe that there is not one type of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic glue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in play,
 but two:
 the wedge product,
 and the product by scalar functions.
 However,
 as it turns out,
 the product by a scalar function actually corresponds to the wedge product by a zero-form;
 see appendix A for details.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Wedges as Intersections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our current goal is to decompose a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form into forms of lower dimension.
 From the perspective of our framework,
 in which a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form is represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)$
\end_inset

-dimensional surfaces,
 we wish to write a manifold in terms of manifolds of higher dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may seem abstract,
 but it is very easy to motivate if we think in terms of cartesian equations.
 For example,
 consider a one-dimensional curve in 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{3}$
\end_inset

 such as the red circle in the following figure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The red circle is the intersection of the orange cylinder and blue plane.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This curve can be written in terms of the cartesian equations
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
x^{2}+y^{2}=1,\\
z=1.
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now there is a trivial way to decompose this one-dimensional object as the intersection of two 2-dimensional objects:
 a horizontal plane 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 and a cylinder 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a more or less general phenomenon.
 We can define a 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional surface in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional space through cartesian equations.
 Each of these equations separately defines an 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

-dimensional surface,
 and their intersection is obviously the surface we started with.
 In other words,
 we get a kind of general principle:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A surface 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 contained in -dimensional space can be written as the intersection of 
\begin_inset Formula $n-d$
\end_inset

 hypersurfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to apply to this to our framework for forms.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is represented through 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)$
\end_inset

-surfaces,
 so we should expect to write the surfaces composing 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 as the intersection of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 hypersurfaces;
 that is,
 to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 one-forms.
 Sound familiar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This,
 in turn,
 presents a way to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

glue forms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
 take the intersection of the corresponding surfaces.
 Indeed,
 the notation of wedge product is even suggestive:
 ever notice how 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\eta$
\end_inset

 kind of looks like 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\cap\eta$
\end_inset

?
 I have no idea if this is a coincidence,
 but if so it is a very fortunate one.

Dimensions,
 Orientations and Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Appealing though this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

definition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of wedge product may be,
 it remains to show (or at least,
 plausibly convince) that the wedge product has the properties we have come to expect it to have.
 For example,
 is it even obvious that the dimension of the wedge is the sum of the dimensions of the arguments?
 In this section,
 we sketch arguments to justify the most important properties of the wedge product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dimension:
 First,
 we recall the discussion on transversality above.
 In particular,
 recall that we will always be assuming that all intersections are transverse,
 which bodes very well for dimensional considerations.
 In particular,
 the math checks out:
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

-dimensional,
 they are represented respectively by 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-\ell)$
\end_inset

-surfaces,
 whose intersection has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)+(n-\ell)-n=n-(k+\ell)$
\end_inset

,
 which corresponds,
 as desired,
 to a 
\begin_inset Formula $(k+\ell)$
\end_inset

-form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x\wedge\dl x=0$
\end_inset

:
 The calculation of such a wedge requires a bit of thought.
 At first glance,
 it would seem that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x\wedge\dl x=\dl x$
\end_inset

,
 because we are intersecting a collection of hyperplanes with themselves.
 However,
 the computation cannot be done in this way,
 because a hyperplane is not traverse to itself!
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The way around that is actually to work with two distinct representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed,
 suppose the first is represented by the hyperplanes 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,\varepsilon,2\varepsilon,\dots$
\end_inset

 Then,
 instead of representing the second 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x$
\end_inset

 by the same collection of hyperplanes,
 represent it through 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon,(1+\frac{1}{2})\varepsilon,(2+\frac{1}{2})\varepsilon,\dots$
\end_inset

 Then,
 we have two collections of hyperplanes which never intersect.
 Therefore,
 their intersections are transverse:
 indeed,
 they are empty.
 (Yes,
 an empty intersection is a Good Intersection.) In conclusion,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl x\wedge\dl x=0$
\end_inset

,
 as it ought to.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\eta=(-1)^{k\ell}\eta\wedge\omega$
\end_inset

:
 To talk about this property,
 we would need to go back to the issue of orientations.
 However,
 without getting into it,
 it is a priori obvious that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\eta=\pm\eta\wedge\omega$
\end_inset

,
 as the intersection of two surfaces does not depend on the order in which the intersection is taken.
 However,
 the sign issues arise upon consideration of the 
\emph on
orientation of the intersection
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately,
 the subject of orientation is too complex to be discussed in a mere bullet point,
 so the term must remain mysterious for the time being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Author's note:
 I never wrote down the solution,
 but I promise it exists.
 In summary,
 recall that (as said in a previous author note) what is actually demanded of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a co-orientation,
 and the issue is:
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are co-oriented transversal submanifolds,
 what is the natural co-orientation on 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $B\cap A$
\end_inset

?
 Indeed,
 one takes positively oriented bases of the normal budles of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 and juxtaposes them to make a (by definition,
 positively oriented) basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $B\cap A$
\end_inset

,
 depending on the order.
 These two definitions don't generally agree:
 To turn one basis into the other,
 one needs to perform
\begin_inset FormulaMacro
\newcommand{\codim}{\mathop{\mathrm{codim}}}
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\codim A\codim B$
\end_inset

 swaps in the basis,
 which leads to a difference of orientation of sign 
\begin_inset Formula $(-1)^{\codim A\codim B}$
\end_inset

.
 This is where the 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ell$
\end_inset

 term comes from.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Associativity:
 Like in the previous bullet point,
 it is obvious that the wedge product would be associative up to sign.
 To show that the orientations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\wedge(\beta\wedge\gamma)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha\wedge\beta)\wedge\gamma$
\end_inset

 match up would require a deeper inspection of the orientation conventions,
 but it does check out.

 Then,
 the pullback of a form

 is usually defined as follows:

Symbolically,
 this is a very natural operation to define,

For simplicity,
 let us consider a one-form

 though the following argument applies to higher-dimensional forms as well.
 Recall that we represent

 through a collection of hypersurfaces,
 and to evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(v)$

 on a vector

we count how many of the hypersurfaces the vector

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently,
 to evaluate

\end_inset

on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 tangent to

,
 what one does is push the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 forwards and counts how many surfaces of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 it crosses.
 However,
 a bit of mental gymnastics should convince you of the following alternative definition:

To evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{*}\omega(w)$

,
 pull the surfaces composing 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 back into

\end_inset

 (taking their preimage in 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 and count how many of those

 crosses.

 In other words,
 we can represent

Then,
 we begin flowing for positive time.
 The vector field in question points outwards from the origin,
 so since we are taking the preimage under the flow we move the atoms inwards.
 By solving the ODE,
 it is easy to check that an atom starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y$
\end_inset

) will,
 after time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

,
 be at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\e^{-t}(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 we conclude that our uniform mesh of points is being pulled towards the origin in a way that preserves uniformity:
 after time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

,
 distances between points have been uniformly compressed by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\e^{-t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This even allows us to compute explicitly 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{t}^{*}\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed,
 a uniform mesh of points represents a form of the type 
\begin_inset Formula $C\,\dl x\wedge\dl y$
\end_inset

,
 so all that remains is to find 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 A heuristic argument is as follows:
 since in every direction,
 points are denser by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\e^{t}$
\end_inset

,
 the amount of points in a given parallelogram has been increased by 
\begin_inset Formula $(\e^{t})^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words,
 we claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{t}^{*}\omega=\e^{2t}\,\dl x\wedge\dl y$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A slightly less heuristic argument is to start with the unit square at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

,
 and flow it 
\shape italic
backwards
\shape default
 for time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This will result in a smaller square,
 of side 
\begin_inset Formula $\e^{-t}$
\end_inset

,
 which contains exactly the same atoms,
 whence we conclude
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi_{t}^{*}\omega(\e^{-t}\partial_{x},\e^{-t}\partial_{y})=\omega(\partial_{x},\partial_{y})=1.
\]

\end_inset

Now that we are familiar with the pullback of a form under a flow,
 all that remains is to differentiate.
 Unfortunately,
 the only visualization I am able to provide is very lackluster,
 and I encourage any reader who has a better idea to contact me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us visualize differentiation using infinitesimals.
 In what follows,
 let 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 be a very small positive number.
 Then,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\diffat t0\phi_{t}^{*}\omega=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}(\phi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\omega-\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 In other words,
 we begin by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
 flowing it backwards through 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 for infinitesimal time,
 and subtracting 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 again.
 Now,
 this is zero to zeroth order,
 so we divide by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 in order to get a real-valued thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's elaborate a bit on the flow part for a moment.
 To first order,
 taking the flow in infinitesimal time is just calculating the velocity vector at the point and moving in the direction of the tip.
 In other words,
 (visualizing vectors as infinitesimal arrows) we may visualize 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\omega$
\end_inset

 by,
 for each point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of each atom 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

,
 evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{p}$
\end_inset

 at that point and placing the arrow so that the
\emph on
 tip
\emph default
 is at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 by the tail of the arrow 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 Doing this process for each point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

,
 we obtain a new surface 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 which is the atom of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\omega$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to the atom 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Repeating this process for every atom 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 we obtain the atoms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\omega$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for the example with the volume form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{2}$
\end_inset

,
 and the radial field.
 Given a red atom at 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

,
 the corresponding orange atom is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)-\varepsilon X_{(x,y)}$
\end_inset

,
 that is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(x,y)-\varepsilon X_{(x,y)}=(1-\varepsilon)(x,y).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore,
 we have a grid of uniformly spaced atoms,
 with a unit area square with sides 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\varepsilon)\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\varepsilon)\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 an argument similar to above will show that the orange atoms represent the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\omega=(1-\varepsilon)^{-2}\,\dl x\wedge\dl y
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and therefore we may calculate the Lie derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Lie_{X}\omega=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}(\phi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\omega-\omega)=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}((1-\varepsilon)^{-2}-1)\,\dl x\wedge\dl y,
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and a bit of elementary calculus shows that,
 taking the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\to0$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Lie_{X}\omega=\frac{(1-\varepsilon)^{-2}-1}{\varepsilon}\,\dl x\wedge\dl y=2\,\dl x\wedge\dl y.

Contraction/Inner Product

 it seems difficult to visualize the contraction,
 because it is explicitly defined in terms of evaluation.
 In case you've forgotten or have never heard of it,

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 We then take the union of all the points on all of these vectors,

Cartan's Magical Formulas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are now ready to look at Cartan's magic formula for the Lie derivative,
 as we have already seen the three necessary ingredients:
 the Lie derivative,
 contraction,
 and the exterior derivative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us begin by noting the relation between these three concepts.
 Given a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and a form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
 both the Lie derivative and the contraction are related to the notion of

gluing the tip of

\end_inset

 into the atoms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Indeed,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is a top form (i.e.
 its atoms are points) a useful identity appears:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Lie_{X}\omega=\dl(X\into\omega).

\begin_layout Standard
This identity is the first version of Cartan's magic formula,
 and it actually works whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is a closed form.
 However,
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has atoms with nonempty border,
 a new term appears.
 To visualize why,
 suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is not a closed form,
 and has an atom 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with border 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial A$
\end_inset

.
 Assume for the sake of terminology that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is one-dimensional,
 so that we may call it a curve with one or two extrema.
 Then,
 
\begin_inset Formula $X\into A$
\end_inset

 is a strip.
 One of its sides is exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Let us call the opposite side 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 and the one or two other sides will be called 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 on the one hand,
 the atom corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lie_{X}\omega$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $A+B$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dl(X\into\omega)$
\end_inset

 includes 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,
 but also 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

,
 so we need to remove that term.
 A little bit of thought shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is an atom from 
\begin_inset Formula $X\into\dl\omega$
\end_inset

,
 and so,
 modulo signs,
 we reach the famous formula
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Lie_{X}\omega=\dl(X\into\omega)+X\into\dl\omega.
