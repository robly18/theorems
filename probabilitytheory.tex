	\section{Measure theory 101}
	
	\subsection{Basic definitions}
	
	Fix a set $\Omega$, which will be our so-called \emph{sample space}.
	
	\begin{definition}
	A \emph{sample space} or \emph{$\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$} is a set $\M \subseteq \PP(\Omega)$ satisfying the following properties:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	\item $\emptyset, \Omega \in \M$;
	
	\item If $A \in \M$, then $A^\cc := \Omega \setminus A \in \M$.
	
	\item If $\{A_n\}_{n \in \N}$ is a countable collection of sets in $\M$, then $\bigcup A_n \in \M$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}
	
	These properties (closed under complement and countable unions) imply $\M$ is also closed under countable intersection.
	
	\begin{definition}
	Fixed a $\sigma$-algebra $\M$ on $\Omega$, a function $\mu : \M \to \left[0, \infty \right]$ is called a \emph{measure} if $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$ and $\mu$ is countably additive, that is, if $\{A_n\}$ is a countable collection of disjoint elements of $\M$, we have
	
	\[\mu(\bigcup A_n) = \sum \mu A_n.\]
	\end{definition}
	
	A measure $\mu$ is said to be \emph{finite} if $\mu(X) < \infty$. It is said to be \emph{$\sigma$-finite} if there exists a countable collection $\{A_n\}$ of sets of finite measure whose union covers $X$.
	
	\subsection{Topological spaces}
	
	Among the several trivial examples of $\sigma$-algebras, a certain type stands out that turns out to be fundamental when speaking of measures on $\R$.
	
	It is known that there is no measure on $\PP(\R)$ that extends the notion of `length of an interval' reasonably. (Rip Vitali set) Therefore, instead of aiming so high, it is convenient to look for how little work we can do.
	
	In particular, if we want to define a measure on a $\sigma$-algebra that contains all the intervals, we may begin by asking what is the \emph{smallest} $\sigma$-algebra that contains all intervals. Fortunately, arbitrary intersections of $\sigma$-algebras are also $\sigma$-algebras, it makes sense to speak of the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing a certain class of sets $\A$. We call this \emph{the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\A$}, sometimes denoted $\M(\A)$.
	
	More generally, fixed a topological space $\T$, we usually consider the open sets to be `nice' in some way. As such, we may wish to look for a measure defined on all the opens. This means it would have to be defined on the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\T$, which appears so often it is given a name: the \emph{Borel} $\sigma$-algebra, denoted $\B_\T$, or, depending on the context, $\B_\Omega$ or just $\B$.
	
	Back to the particular case of $\R$, the Borel $\sigma$-algebra is precisely the same as the one generated by the intervals, or by the closed intervals, or by the open intervals, or by the half-open intervals, or by the intervals of the form $\left[a, \infty\right[$, or... (The list goes on and on.)
	
	A measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ is said to be a \emph{Borel measure} if, assuming $\Omega$ is endowed with a topology, the $\sigma$-algebra $\mu$ is defined on contains all the Borel sets. Such a measure is said to be \emph{locally finite} if it is finite on all compacts.
	
	\section{Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures}
	
	This section is dedicated to the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on $\R$. In simple terms, there is a correspondence between locally finite measures on the Borels and right-continuous increasing functions on $\R$.
	
	For simplicity, we will henceforth use the term RCIF to mean `right-continuous increasing function'.
	
	It is easy to, given a locally finite Borel measure, find a RCIF $F$ such that
	\begin{equation}\label{lsm}\mu \left]a, b\right] = F(b) - F(a).\end{equation}
	
	Indeed, simply define
	\[
	F(x) = \begin{cases}
	\mu \left]0, x \right] & \text{if $x \geq 0$}\\
	-\mu \left]x, 0\right] & \text{if $x \leq 0$}
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	On the other hand, to, given a RCIF $F$, construct a measure $\mu$ such that \eqref{lsm} is verified, is significantly harder. In any case, a Borel measure $\mu$ under these conditions is called \emph{the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure defined by $F$}. Not only is it not obvious that such a thing exists, it is also not clear that it should be unique. And yet.
	
	Todo: maybe do this.
	
	\section{Measurable functions}
	
	Analogously to the notion of continuous function, which is one that in some way preserves the structure of the topology, one can define a \emph{measurable function} as one that, in some sense, preserves the structure of a measure space.
	
	Concretely, if $(X, \M)$ and $(Y, \CN)$ are sample spaces, a function $f : X \to Y$ is said to be measurable if the preimage of any element of $\CN$ is in $\M$. That is, the preimage of a measurable is measurable.
	
	Measurable functions are of utmost importance in the theory of integration, because it is precisely on these functions that we define the Lebesgue integral.
	
	Furthermore, it is measurable functions that capture the concept of random variable. Indeed, a, let's say real-valued, random variable $X$ is no more than a measurable function from the sample space $(\Omega, \M)$ to the real line endowed with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra.
	
	\section{Integrability}
	
	Todo
	
	\section{Product spaces}
	
	Given a collection $\{(\Omega_\alpha, \M_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in I}$ of $\sigma$-algebras, we define the product space $\bigotimes_{\alpha\in I} \M_\alpha$ as the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the sets of the form
	\[ \pi_\alpha^{-1}(E)\text{, for $\alpha \in I$ and $E \in \M_\alpha$}.\]
	
	This $\sigma$-algebra on $\prod_{\alpha \in I} \Omega_\alpha$ corresponds to the category-theoretic notion of product, which shows, among other things, that it is associative up to canonical isomorphism.
	
	The product of two sample spaces corresponds to running two experiments separately and independently of one another.
