Office Hours and E-mail
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Office hours are an opportunity for you to meet with me in person outside of class time and ask me questions.
 All questions are welcome â€“ questions about homework assignments,
 material discussed in class,
 relations between concepts,
 etc.
 I will be scheduling three weekly hours of office hours sometime in Week 1,
 based on student responses to a poll to ensure that everyone can attend some office hour timeslot.
 It is your responsibility to fill out this poll to ensure that you are able to attend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a question that you feel does not warrant coming to meet me in person,
 you are welcome to contact me via e-mail (see above).
 I usually reply to e-mails within a few hours.
 However,
 I reserve the right to tell you that your question is too complex to deal with over e-mail,
 and invite you to attend office hours to discuss it in person.

\begin_layout Subsection
Course Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Math 19620 is a one-quarter course in linear algebra,
 intended primarily for students majoring in the social sciences.
 All fields of science use linearity as an assumption to approximate problems to facilitate the finding of solutions.
 Linear algebra is a mathematical tool that is just as fundamental as calculus.
 Topics includes systems of linear equations;
 linear transformations,
 matrices,
 determinants;
 linear (vector) spaces,
 bases,
 dimensions;
 orthogonality,
 the method of least squares;
 eigenvalues,
 eigenvectors and dynamical systems.
 While much of the course is computational in nature,
 an emphasis will also be placed on conceptual understanding,
 logical reasoning and clear communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Course Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the end of the quarter you will be able to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
construct a valid and clearly articulated mathematical argument with appropriate use of mathematical logic and language;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
do your own research to learn a new mathematical concept,
 building on prior knowledge;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use a variety of strategies to determine solvability of linear equations and to find the solutions when they exist;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
demonstrate both an algebraic and a geometric understanding of linear transformation and their properties;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
apply fundamental concepts of matrices and linear transformations to solve problems,
 both in other areas of mathematics and in science (particularly in social science).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Homework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problem sets will be assigned on a weekly basis,
 covering the material discussed in class in the previous week.
 Homework will be assigned in the afternoon of Thursday of every week and due a week after.
 The purpose of these problem sets is to ensure that you are keeping up with course material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problem sets will be mostly direct application of class material,
 but each problem set will contain a challenging problem that will require proper understanding of the material.

\begin_layout Subsection
Midterm Projects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There will be two projects during the course of this class,
 roughly around Week 2 and Week 6.
 Collaboration is encouraged,
 as is asking for help in office hours,
 but nevertheless 
\series bold
these projects are intended to be solved individually.

\series default
 See also the Collaboration Policy (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:collaboration"

\end_inset

) below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the class after each project is due,
 there will be a short (30 minutes) in-class midterm.
 This midterm should be easy to someone who has done the entirety of their own project.
 Your grade in the project will be weighed in accordance with your performance on the midterm,
 as given by the formula (where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

midterm grade
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ranges from 0 to 100):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{final project grade}=\text{project grade}\times\min\left(1,\frac{\text{midterm grade}+30}{100}\right).
\]

\end_inset

In particular,
 if you get 70% or higher on the midterm,
 your project grade will be counted in its entirety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also reserve the right to,
 in the event that I suspect malfeasance,
 call you in for an in-person oral examination about the project.
 I expect that this will not be necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The midterm projects are intended to test your understanding of prior class material,
 your ability to research and apprehend novel material,
 and your ability to articulate proper and correct mathematical arguments.
 They will be based on a section of the textbook that will not be directly covered in class,
 but understanding this material is predicated on understanding the previous sections.
 Project exercises will be graded according to the following rubric:

Submissions on projects or homework will be due at 23h59 of the respective day.

 In order to account for unexpected circumstances,

 You may not claim two extensions for the same homework.

Collaboration Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a professional or academic setting,
 collaboration and teamwork is the norm.
 However,
 care must be taken to give proper credit:
 presenting someone else's ideas as though they were your own constitutes academic fraud.
 In accordance,
 collaboration is accepted for all assignments in this course unless indicated otherwise,
 but you should clearly state who your collaborators were and give credit where due.
 This also applies to help found from other online sources,
 e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

Stackoverflow,
 ChatGPT,
 etc.
 Nevertheless,
 you should ensure that you understand everything you write.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cheating Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cheating on homework or projects consists of copying someone else's work without attribution,
 or without understanding what you are writing.
 If I suspect a student of having cheated in their homework or project,
 I may summon the student for a short oral examination.
 If I deem that a student has cheated on such an assignment,
 the corresponding assignment will be marked as though an empty submission had been made.
 Repeat offenders will be reported,
 leading to a mark on their academic transcript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cheating on an exam is a far more serious matter.
 Possible ways to cheat on an exam are far too numerous,
 so I will simply say:
 I am the final arbiter of what counts as cheating or not.
 If I catch you cheating on the exam,
 your exam grade will be severely penalized,
 and you will be reported to the University,
 leading to a mark on your academic transcript.

Electronics Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies have shown that the usage of electronics (tablets,
 computers,
 phones) is distracting to the user and to others.
 I will not stop you from making use of whatever electronics you please (so long as they do not disturb the rest of the class),
 but I do ask that if you will be using such a device for more than taking notes you should sit near the rear of the classroom.

 If in doubt,

Religious Accommodation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The University of Chicago is home to students of all the worldâ€™s major religions and,
 though firmly a secular institution,
 values the rich diversity of spiritual expression and practice found on campus.
 It is therefore the policy of the University that students who miss class,
 assignments,
 or exams to observe a religious holiday must be accommodated as follows:
 (i) absences may not be counted as a missed class in any course in which attendance is a measure of academic performance;
 (ii) reasonable extensions of time must be given,
 without academic penalty,
 for missed assignments;
 and (iii) exams must be reasonably rescheduled without academic penalty.
 Where a religious holiday occurs during the first week of the quarter,
 students who miss the first meeting of a class due to religious observance may not be dropped from the course roster,
 provided that they have given advance notice to the instructor of record of the need to miss the class due to a religious holiday.
