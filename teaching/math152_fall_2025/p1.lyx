Project Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Submit a solution to the following questions on Canvas by 23h59 of the due date.
 Late submissions will be accepted,
 but lose 1% of the total grade for each 10 minutes late.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collaboration is accepted,
 but you should clearly state who your collaborators were and give credit where due.
 This also applies to help found from other online sources,
 e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

Stackoverflow,
 ChatGPT,
 etc.
 However,
 you should ensure that you understand everything you write.
 
\series bold
There will be an in-class quiz in the first class after the due date regarding the project.

\series default
 See syllabus for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your project may be prepared however you like,
 including:
 handwritten,
 written on a tablet,
 typed in MS Word,
 typed in \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
 a mix of the above,
 etc.
 However,
 part of the grading rubric (see below) includes presentation.
 Unless your handwriting is flawless,
 you are 
\series bold
strongly encouraged
\series default
 to produced typed work rather than handwritten.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to combat inconsistent expectations,
 students whose grade in the first project is inferior to 90% will be allowed to consult with me as to produce an improved version of their project.
 At a later date,
 they will be allowed to re-submit their project and have their grade changed in accordance,
 though the revised grade will be capped at 90%.
 The timeline for resubmission depends on several factors and has not been determined at the date of writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are strongly encouraged to discuss the project with me or with your peers.
 You are welcome to come to office hours to ask about it.
 At the moment that the project is released,
 you already know all the material that you need to work on it.
 Start early.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
My name is Bill Johnson.
 I am the chief machine operator at Nuts&Bolts,
 a small company that manufactures nuts,
 bolts,
 screws,
 nails,
 and other assorted small metallic objects,
 according to customer specification.
 I contact you because I have a problem in my hands that I cannot solve on my own,
 and your calculus instructor kindly referred me to you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our most popular product is the 3'' bolt.
 As the name indicates,
 this is a bolt that is almost exactly three inches long from the base of the head to the tip of the bolt.
 However,
 due to machinery imprecisions,
 such a bolt is never 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 three inches long;
 it's only 
\emph on
close
\emph default
 to three inches long.
 How close it is to exactly three inches depends from application to application;
 some customers require sub-millimeter accuracy,
 while others are fine with deviations up to a quarter-inch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me tell you a little about the manufacturing process.
 We have a casting machine into which we pour some amount of molten iron,
 and out the other side comes a bolt.
 The length of said bolt depends on the amount of molten iron that is input into the casting machine.
 If,
 say,
 we input 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 one fluid once (
\begin_inset Formula $1\floz$
\end_inset

),
 then the engineers tell me that the resulting bolt will be exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $3\inch$
\end_inset

 long.
 Unfortunately,
 the machine that dispenses molten iron cannot dispense exactly this amount,
 or any amount really.
 You see,
 all these machines work in tolerances:
 All I can do is tell the machine to dispense 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one fluid ounce,
 within an error of (say) 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01\floz$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So my problem is:
 When a client tells me the tolerance they have for the length of a bolt,
 I need to know what tolerance I should give the molten iron dispenser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 now,
 I know what you're thinking.
 Why don't I just give the dispenser some ridiculously low error margin,
 like 
\begin_inset Formula $0.000001\floz$
\end_inset

?
 There are two reasons.
 The first is that this taxes the machine overmuch.
 It's okay for tolerances like these to be used in rare occasions,
 but it would not be sustainable to demand this much precision regularly.
 The second is liability:
 If something goes wrong with a building made using my bolts,
 I need to have undeniable proof that the issue does not lie with my product,
 or else I'm vulnerable to a lawsuit.
 This is why I need your help:
 I will need to be able to prove,
 beyond shadow of a doubt,
 that the tolerances I'll be using for the amount of metal lead to bolts within the tolerance requested by the client.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going back to the manufacturing process:
 The reason I need this information is because we just purchased a new casting machine,
 and it works differently from the other one.
 For the other machine,
 when I input 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 fluid ounces of metal,
 I was told that the resulting bolt would be 
\begin_inset Formula $8X-1$
\end_inset

 inches long.
 At the time,
 we contracted some engineer to do the math,
 and she told us that if we wanted a bolt that was 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 inches long within an error 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 (in inches),
 we should input 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\floz$
\end_inset

 of metal within an error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{8}E\floz$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 I never felt quite satisfied with this explanation;
 I understand that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{8}$
\end_inset

 comes from the 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 in the other formula,
 but that's as far as I understood...
 If you could explain this math to me as well,
 that would be splendid.
 Anyway,
 for this new machine,
 the formula is a little more complicated:
 If I input 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 fluid ounces of metal,
 the manual says that the resulting bolt is 
\begin_inset Formula $2X^{2}+2X-1$
\end_inset

 inches long (if this gives a negative value – I've experimented – the result is a poor misshapen embryo of a bolt...
 But I don't expect any client to ask for a 3'' bolt with 
\begin_inset Formula $3\inch$
\end_inset

 of tolerance,
 so this shouldn't be an issue).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you think you could provide me with some formula so that,
 if I am given the level of tolerance that a client has for a 3'' bolt,
 I can calculate the level of tolerance to give the molten iron dispenser?
 (I will always ask the molten iron dispenser for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\floz$
\end_inset

 of iron,
 plus minus tolerance.) The formula doesn't have to be the best possible;
 if something needs (strictly speaking) a tolerance of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\floz$
\end_inset

,
 but your formula gives me 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\floz$
\end_inset

 or so,
 that's OK!
 However,
 it would 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be acceptable if,
 under these circumstances,
 it produced a tolerance of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.1\floz$
\end_inset

.
 Please explain your formula,
 and why it works,
 as well as you can;
 my math is a little rusty,
 and truth be told it's been a while since I've done any math that's more advanced than solving simple equations or transferring between different units,
 but as the chief machine operator,
 if something goes wrong with the bolts then I am the one who has to defend my methods in court.
 Please also don't forget to explain the formula for the prior machine.
