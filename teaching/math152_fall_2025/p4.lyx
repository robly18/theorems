Hey there!
 It's Chuck Finley again.
 I have another problem for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was reassigned to the biological department.
 Still working on Mars colonies,
 but now they're bacterial colonies.
 We're trying to look into using bacteria as a source of food and oxygen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have you heard of cyanobacteria?
 These are bacteria that can do photosynthesis,
 like trees.
 What that means is that they're relatively easy to grow in space – they require a steady supply of a few nutrients,
 but aside from that,
 they make copies of themselves on the Sun's dime,
 and even produce oxygen for free as a thank-you.
 We would really like to have as many of these puppies growing on our spacedomes as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enter Larry.
 I hate Larry.
 We've been butting heads since high school,
 and I really don't like the guy.
 He proposed this idea to our boss Madeline,
 and he was making a huge deal of how this is 
\emph on
suuuch
\emph default
 a good idea,
 because bacterial colonies grow exponentially and so we'd have billions of the little guys in no time,
 all from a small sample that we could easily bring from Earth.
 Now,
 if this is true,
 that would be really good news for our Mars colonies,
 but frankly I'd be way happier to prove him wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 I don't know a damn thing about bacteria,
 so I called a buddy of mine who's doing a PhD in biology – her name is Fiona –,
 and she said that the whole exponential growth ordeal only works so long as the bacteria have unlimited resources and space to grow.
 Apparently,
 past some point they start stepping on each other's turf and the entire growth rate slows down to a crawl.
 She said that their behavior is pretty complex,
 but to a good approximation,
 they behave in this manner that she called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the logistic model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have you learned about differential equations?
 I hope you have,
 because I need your help making sense of this.
 My buddy Fiona said that if 
\begin_inset Formula $B(t)$
\end_inset

 represents the amount of bacteria at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (I don't think it matters too much how you measure them),
 the speed of growth is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $k\cdot B(t)\cdot\frac{M-B(t)}{M}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 are some fixed numbers that depend on the species and the environment.
 Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 represents the maximum population that the colony could have in this environment,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is some number that represents how fast the little buggers multiply.

\end_inset

 The model kind of made sense:
 The way she explained it,
 the more bacteria you have the faster they reproduce (which is why we multiply by 
\begin_inset Formula $B(t)$
\end_inset

),
 but the less space they have the more likely they are to trample each other,
 or to decide that the whole splitting business isn't worth it anyway (which is why we multiply by that complicated fraction,
 which represents the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the little guys have to make copies of themselves).
 Now,
 this is all well and good,
 but what I'd really like to have is a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $B(t)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Honestly,
 I'm not even sure that this whole equation is enough to figure out exactly how they grow.
 I remember from my college days that sometimes these differential equations have a whole orchestra of solutions,
 not just one,
 and I need your help to find all of them.
 When I present this to my boss,
 I gotta have a bulletproof case – if Larry finds an error in what I'm saying,
 he's going to tear the whole thing down,
 and he'll get promoted and I'll get a new job as a janitor at NASA.
 So,
 to recap:
 If we assume that my buddy Fiona is right,
 and bacteria really do behave in the way that she's saying,
 what's the formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $B(t)$
\end_inset

 look like?
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last thing:
 I took the liberty of collecting some data so we can find out if your predictions match reality.
 I borrowed a test tube from the biolab,
 filled it with horse blood (yuck!) up to 8cm high,
 and put a small sample of E.
 Coli into the tube.
 Then I left it out in the air to see what happened.
 When I came back at 6am the next day,
 there was a blotch of stuff growing at the bottom – maybe 1cm high?
 By noon,
 the blotch had grown to 2cm,
 and at 6pm it was at 3.5cm high.
 When I came to the office at 6am the very next day,
 it hadn't quite filled the entire bottle to the brim,
 but it was maybe at 6.5cm,
 and when I left the office at 6pm that night there was very little clear blood,
 maybe half a centimeter?
 By 6am the next day,
 the entire vial was consumed by the stuff,
 and I threw it down the toilet.
 Anyway,
 that's the data I got – let me know if the formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $B(t)$
\end_inset

 seems to match these results,
 'cause if it doesn't then I gotta go back to the drawing board.

\end_layout

\end_inset

It seems that scientists have two different models for how bacteria grow:
 The exponential model 
\begin_inset Formula $B'(t)=k\,B(t)$
\end_inset

 and the logistic model given above.
 Both of these give very different predictions:
 For example,
 one model predicts that the bacteria will grow without bound,
 while the other model predicts that they will plateau.
 Is one of the models right and the other wrong?
 What's going on here?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise
Write a paragraph or two reconciling the differences between the two models.
 To this effect,
 you should justify the following sentence,
 and explain why it implies that,
 under certain circumstances (what circumstances?) the two models will give very close predictions:
