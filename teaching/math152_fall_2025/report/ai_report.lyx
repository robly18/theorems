Hi Duarte,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I’ve read the email regarding AI accusations,
 and just to lay it out in case I had infractions,
 here are the cases in which I have used AI:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 2:
 - to help count how many squares there were in the leaf because I kept losing track and decided it was busy work sorry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 3:
 - to explain the question given that I didn’t understand the correspondence at first:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said,
 I didn’t use a C = 1.9 because the document said we can use a C = 1,
 I don’t know why it gave me C = 1.9.
 On the syllabus at 2.8,
 it said we could use it for “asking for an explanation of a definition”,
 but I used it to dumb down what the problem was truly asking of me because I was confused as to what it wanted,
 essentially explaining the project’s question in a simpler sense.
 Hence,
 I used it to try and dumb down the project.
 As for the leaf,
 I saw it as rather useless given that I kept losing track of counting so I resorted to AI usage to count the squares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are my usages of AI,
 and I apologize for the infractions.
 I was under the impression that we could use it for trying to understand the question and for monotonous tasks like counting,
 but if not,
 I accept the consequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thank you,

Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have strong suspicion that this student is lying to me,
 and has used AI more than he has let on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 there is the fact that both his Project 2 and Project 3 are lacking in figures,
 which seems to be a giveaway.
 Moreover,
 Project 3 was very visual and required one to calculate the areas of certain rectangles on the surface of the sphere – which this student did correctly,
 despite not having any figures of such rectangles,
 without which the task would be quite difficult.
 Moreover,
 in his in-class quiz,
 he seemed quite unsure of how to decompose the sphere into rectangles,
 which I would not expect from a student who did work of his project's quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 his project makes use of spherical coordinates.
 According to Sarah Ziesler,
 this is already unusual for a student who got placed into MATH 152,
 but even more suspicious is the fact that he uses the following coordinates:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 It's unusual that a coordinate is dedicated for the radius,
 since the problem takes place on a sphere so a radial coordinate is unnecessary,
 but it's also surprising that he chose 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for the radial coordinate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three results upon searching 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spherical coordinates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on Google are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Wikipedia,
 which uses 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for radius but otherwise agrees with the student's conventions,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Paul's online notes,
 which uses 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for radius but otherwise has 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 swapped,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and Wolfram Mathworld,
 which both uses 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for the radial coordinate,
 and also has 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 the opposite way from the student.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these,
 only Paul's notes use 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for radius,
 and he does not discuss the area element.
 On the other hand,
 here is the output from ChatGPT upon inserting the Project prompt:
\end_layout

\end_inset

While it still differs in terms of choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (which can be attributed to the fact that the problem statement is biased in that direction),
 the pattern (start with the coordinates and then immediately provide the area element with no justification (which they were supposed to do in the project...)) is very similar.
 Here is another iteration of ChatGPT's output:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This iteration uses 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

,
 but otherwise looks very similar to the student's solution in form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the project statement includes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

false solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 but it instructs the reader that they don't need to explain why it's incorrect.
 Nevertheless,
 every time I queried ChatGPT it provided an explanation of why it is incorrect,
 and this student did as well:

\end_inset

Lastly,
 I note that the student referred to an incorrect argument as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

creative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In my experience,
 this is something that ChatGPT often does faced with incorrect material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my opinion,
 this is a strong case that this work was made with heavy use of ChatGPT,
 despite the student's claim that ChatGPT was used only to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explain the project's question
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will call the student over to my office,
 and ask him where he learned about spherical coordinates,
 and to explain them to me.
 I will ask him to explain how he figured out the area of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small spots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the student fails to provide a reasonable explanation,
 I will apply the following consequences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Report him to the Office of College Community Standards for further investigation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Count Project 3 as a 0,
 and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disallow Project 3 from counting as his lowest grade,
 leading in conjunction with the previous item to a deduction of 15% to his final grade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the student provides a reasonable explanation,
 give him a slap on the wrist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Post Meeting Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jonathan was able to provide me with reasonable doubt as to whether he used AI.
 When prompted as to where he learned spherical coordinates,
 he successfully provided a source on the spot,
 and the way in which he reached this source was circuitous enough (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I looked up an image of how to plot points on the sphere,
 then I went to this image,
 which led me to this website...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that I don't think it's the kind of excuse that he would have prepared in advance or come up with on the spot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

area of the small spots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 he said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a friend who knows multivariable told me to just use this formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I cannot prove that this friend is not AI,
 but I cannot prove that it is AI either.
 He was unable to justify the formula.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ultimately decided to dock him 5 points on rubric item 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

provide citations for formulas
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 and effect no other punishment.
 I will also be sending him an e-mail telling him that he should not use AI to read for him,
 and he should give credit to people he collaborates with.

Good evening!

I just saw your email about AI Accusations and wanted to state my use of collaboration and my use of AI for definitions.

I didn't list collaborators on my work previously (I honestly forgot).
 However,
 I collaborated with Ivan for P1,
 Ivan and Edgar for P2,
 and Sophia and Andrea for P3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally,
 I've read Google AI summary in combination with online resources like YouTube videos to define some formulas used in my projects.
 For example,
 last project I read into the reasoning behind the rsin(theta) the formula because I had forgotten how to explain it well.
 Frankly,
 though,
 I find YouTube videos much more helpful for understanding the reason behind the formulas.
 I assumed this was an appropriate use since the syllabus allows me to use AI for definitions,
 but I just wanted to be 100% safe.

I hope this helps and I am sorry that you must go through the trouble of digging through AI usage in work.

\begin_layout Standard
Hi,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am writing about my possible inappropriate use of AI in project 3.
 To start,
 I want to say that all of the writing itself in the project was done entirely by me,
 and I didn't use any AI for the writing.
 The idea to cut the dome into "flat" horizontal rings was also of my own,
 despite it being a flawed approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My use of AI began with finding the radius of each horizontal ring.
 I knew I had to use right angle trig,
 but I didn't know exactly how,
 so I asked AI,
 which helped me find that instead of the circumference being 2(pi)r,
 it was 2(pi)rsin(theta).
 Second,
 I wasn't sure how to find the height of each small ring,
 so I asked AI which directed me to use the arc-length approach,
 which was how I found the height of each ring to be rd(theta).
 This is why in my project there is a major disconnect in the explanation and why it is almost like I was just throwing and mixing around variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did not copy any AI-generated wording into my project,
 but I did rely on those explanations to help me explain and write those steps in the project.
 Looking at the syllabus,
 this action might fall into the category of inappropriate us of AI.
 My use of AI definitely contributed to my low grade on the project,
 because if I had actually spent time trying to figure it out on my own I would have realized that my entire approach on the project (using "flat" rings) was entirely incorrect from the start.
\end_layout

I apologize and it won't happen again,

Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The student's inappropriate usage of AI seems to have bounced back on her.
 She got a 66 out of 100 in Project 3.
 This,
 together with the fact that she seems to have understood the pitfalls of AI usage in this context and made a sincere-looking apology,
 makes me inclined to be lenient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the student effectively admitted to having AI do a significant portion of the work for her (namely,
 calculating certain areas and lengths),
 I will ask her to meet and ask whether she now understands the formulas that she used AI to obtain.
 If she used AI to obtain these formulas and gave them no further thought,
 this definitely counts as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

having AI solve the problem for you
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which it already does,
 anyway),
 and I will remove the points attributed to correct mathematics (7.9 points).
 On the other hand,
 if she is able to explain the formulas,
 no penalty.
 In either case,
 make it clear that it is not acceptable to have AI do all the thinking for her and have her serve as a middleman.

Dear Professor Maia,

I hope you’re doing well.
 I don’t know if this goes against policy,
 but I wanted to clarify if what I did went against policies about using generative AI.
 I was very confused about the third project and felt unsure whether I fully understood the prompt,
 so I pasted the instructions into ChatGPT for it to restate the instructions in a clearer way.
 It gave me a general outline of how someone might think about approaching a problem like this,
 which helped me better understand what the assignment was asking for.
 I used it to make sure I correctly understood the prompt and give some instructions on how to do it.
 I wanted to let you know just in case there was any confusion about this project.

\begin_layout Standard
This student's work has blatant signs of AI usage.
 Notably,
 it contains,
 from start to finish,
 the assumption that a certain constant from the project statement,
 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

,
 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.9$
\end_inset

,
 a trap I deliberately set as invisible text in the problem statement.
 Moreover,
 the admission clearly indicates improper usage of AI,
 though the language used makes it seem like the student does not believe that this goes against the policy at all.
 Namely:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I pasted the instructions into ChatGPT for it to restate the instructions in a clearer way.
 It gave me a general outline of how someone might think about approaching a problem like this
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 when a large portion of the goal was the project was for the students to think about how to approach this problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm genuinely unsure as to whether this student is downplaying his usage of AI as to seem less like a cheater,
 or whether he genuinely has no conception that this was not an OK thing to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of his AI usage,
 this student's work clearly shows that he did not create an understanding of how to approach such a problem and why this would give a correct answer.
 Here is an excerpt from his solution:

 However,
 at no point in the course have we discussed the notion of integral over a surface – only definite integrals with a parameter ranging between two numbers.
 I believe that this is nomenclature that the student does not understand,
 and has taken from ChatGPT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless,
 despite this student's e-mail being written so sparsely and in a tone that tries very hard to absolve him of guilt,
 I do not have reason to believe that he has ommitted anything intentionally.
 He has flat out admitted to cheating as though he did not do anything wrong.

I will call the student to my office and ask him in more detail how he prompted ChatGPT.
 My prediction is that it should not be very hard to reach the conclusion that he flat out asked ChatGPT to solve the project,

 If this prediction is correct,
 I will:

Hello,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the last project,
 I used PhoenixAI to check my work in lieu of having my friend in IBL (who I cited on the first project) look it over.
 I gave a PDF of the completed correspondence and asked it to grade it according to the syllabus.
 Ironically,
 as LLMs are yes-man machines,
 it told me I did a bang-up job but that I should define my variables better and make the text clearer.
 I did add a short injunction explaining why the negative sign in the area calculation was dropped as a result of the feedback.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I understand this as a grey area between "touching up" and asking for "assistance presenting mathematical content,
 whose content is of your own authorship." Given my already low (abnormally such) grade on this assignment,
 I'd ask for no grade deduction in return for a promise not to use AI in such a way again—
if anything,
 it has proved itself to be a poor curative tool,
 so I am not incentivized to use it again.

I am writing to you because I want to be fully transparent about how I used AI for Project 3.
 For the project,
 I consulted AI to ensure I was on the right track throughout the process before meeting with you on Monday.
 I am unsure of whether this violates the guidelines because all ideas and literature are my own,
 but I used it to confirm the validity of my thought process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thank you,
 and I look forward to seeing you next Monday.

\begin_layout Standard
This is a student who has been reliably coming to Office Hours,
 asking for my help,
 and sharing his (own) thought processes,
 so I fully believe that he is competent and has not been using AI as a way to avoid engaging with the material.

Further Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I might recommend that the student stops using AI as a way to recommend the validity of his thought processes simply because it's a very bad tool for that effect.
 Nevertheless,
 I don't believe any punitive action is necessary.

Hi Professor Maia,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hope you're off to having an amazing Thanksgiving!
 This is a documentation of the way I solved projects 1 through 3,
 along with all my uses of ai.
 I’ll be splitting this report into three different sections (one for each project).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I’ve also attached a Google Drive that can be found here:
 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\end_layout

\end_inset

n that includes videos of my physical work on paper.
 These videos show me flipping through the rest of my notebook in order to demonstrate that these notes were not written this week in response to the ai accusations for this class.
 Because I understand that this might not be the most fool proof way of showing that the mathematics are all my own,
 I also cited specific Youtube videos and textbook chapters that I used during my problem solving process (both for the projects as well as homework).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 1:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the epsilon delta proof,
 I primarily referenced this Youtube video (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQBhCuW7Ylg&t=305s
\end_layout

\end_inset

) which details how to apply the proof to quadratic equations.
 As a result,
 much of my understanding and the problem solving I did in the project and related homeworks is a reflection of the strategies shown in that video.
 While the entire correspondence was originally written by me,
 I used generative ai at the end to help me check grammar and rearrange sentences/wording in order to preserve mathematical accuracy.
 When placed into an ai checking tool (I used GPTZero),
 the report returns 75% human written and 25% mixed ai and human,
 leading the checker to be “moderately confident” that the entirety of the project was human written.
 (I posted a screenshot of this in the Google Drive folder).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 2:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In project two,
 the only sources I used were my previous notes on left and right hand Riemann sums as well as the relevant textbook chapters.
 My method for solving the leaf area was relatively unorthodox—
I split the leaf into two separate planes and then applied upper and lower Riemann sums to each area—
so I’m quite confident that generative ai would not have come up with the same mathematical method I used as part of my solution.
 While I wrote the entirety of the report by myself,
 I once again used ai at the end to help check my grammar as well as rearrange my sentences/wording to sound more eloquent to readers.
 My GPTZero score for this project was also 75% human and 25% mixed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 3:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like many of my peers,
 this was the project that I struggled the most on mathematically.
 Although I looked over the relevant textbook chapters that were provided as part of the project description,
 they didn’t help me too much during the actual problem solving.
 As a result,
 I ended up discussing the problem with a couple of my peers in order to better understand the possible ways of solving the correspondence.
 As a disclaimer,
 I’m not fully certain whether they used generative AI to work through the problem,
 nor how that might have shaped my own reasoning.
 In any case,
 this report was my most severe offense of generative ai use.
 Because I had two midterms the same week it was due,
 I procrastinated working on the project until Tuesday.
 I ended up writing a draft of the report and then using ai to help me rewrite the sentences and polish the wording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I’m happy to provide any further details or clarification if needed.
 Thank you so much for taking the time to look through this documentation—
I really appreciate your understanding and patience!

\begin_layout Standard
This is a student I already had marked down as suspicious.
 His Project 3 exhibits a few irregularities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The formulas in his solution are all written 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in text
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 using Unicode symbols and the MS Word feature for subscript and superscript,
 
\shape italic
except
\shape default
 for one last formula at the very end,
 which is flawlessly LaTeXed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He punctuates his equations and math,
 something which he has not done in any homework or in any other project,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
His project includes exactly one figure,
 and it is incorrect and extremely sparse in content (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 He reproduced this figure in the in-class quiz.
 Nevertheless,
 the calculations and final result are all correct.
 I do not believe that the same person who produces Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is capable of flawlessly performing the required reasoning to correctly reach the end of the project.

\begin_layout Standard
In his e-mail,
 Brendan is most vague about his usage of AI in the third project.
 He starts by talking about how he discussed the project with his peers,
 betraying no usage of AI,
 and then writes:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In any case,
 this report was my most severe offense of generative ai use.
 Because I had two midterms the same week it was due,
 I procrastinated working on the project until Tuesday.
 I ended up writing a draft of the report and then using ai to help me rewrite the sentences and polish the wording.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By itself,
 this already definitely counts as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

using AI to 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

touch up
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 a project submission
\begin_inset Quotes erd

,
 which is explicitly disallowed in the syllabus,
 but I moreover believe that his usage of AI runs much deeper that he is admitting to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given how vague Brendan was in his description,
 I would need to collect more data before deciding on an appropriate reprimand.
 Nevertheless,
 at minimum,
 I would remove 50% of his Project grade,
 and most likely also disallow it from counting as his worst project.
 In addition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I will call Brendan to my office and ask to see the draft he submitted to ChatGPT.
 If this draft is severely incomplete or does not contain correct mathematical material,
 I will remove the entirety of his project grade and disallow it from counting as his worst project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I will ask him to explain Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bw1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and its relevance,
 and ask him to draw figures corresponding to other parts of the project,
 such as the area 
\begin_inset Formula $dA$
\end_inset

 of the rings he cuts the sphere into.
 If his mathematical understanding is incorrect and/or severely lacking,
 I will remove the entirety of his project grade and disallow it from counting as his worst project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If both of the previous bullet points apply,
 it is fair to say that Brendan did effectively none of the work he claims ownership over,
 and so I will report him to the Office of College Community Standards.
\end_layout

Student admitted immediately to having used AI to solve the entirety of the project.

This is one of the two students whose project solutions contained the number

 which I hid in invisible text in the project statement.
 It is blatantly clear that some of her work was obtained by putting the project statement into generative AI.

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless,
 this student realized that the output of the AI was nonsensical,
 and came to me for help.
 She attended the office hours the day that the project was due and received plenty of human assistance,
 and I believe that she had a relatively strong understanding of the material by the point that her work was submitted.
 The only mention of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.9$
\end_inset

 is in the very first paragraph,
 with the remainder of the work being,
 I believe,
 fully of her own authorship.

 her work definitely started with her submitting the statement into generative AI,

 since she clearly used AI but did not admit to it,
 I will most likely report her.
