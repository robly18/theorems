Hi Duarte,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I’ve read the email regarding AI accusations,
 and just to lay it out in case I had infractions,
 here are the cases in which I have used AI:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 2:
 - to help count how many squares there were in the leaf because I kept losing track and decided it was busy work sorry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 3:
 - to explain the question given that I didn’t understand the correspondence at first:

\begin_layout Standard
That being said,
 I didn’t use a C = 1.9 because the document said we can use a C = 1,
 I don’t know why it gave me C = 1.9.
 On the syllabus at 2.8,
 it said we could use it for “asking for an explanation of a definition”,
 but I used it to dumb down what the problem was truly asking of me because I was confused as to what it wanted,
 essentially explaining the project’s question in a simpler sense.
 Hence,
 I used it to try and dumb down the project.
 As for the leaf,
 I saw it as rather useless given that I kept losing track of counting so I resorted to AI usage to count the squares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are my usages of AI,
 and I apologize for the infractions.
 I was under the impression that we could use it for trying to understand the question and for monotonous tasks like counting,
 but if not,
 I accept the consequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thank you,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have strong suspicion that this student is lying to me,
 and has used AI more than he has let on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 there is the fact that both his Project 2 and Project 3 are lacking in figures,
 which seems to be a giveaway.
 Moreover,
 Project 3 was very visual and required one to calculate the areas of certain rectangles on the surface of the sphere – which this student did correctly,
 despite not having any figures of such rectangles,
 without which the task would be quite difficult.
 Moreover,
 in his in-class quiz,
 he seemed quite unsure of how to decompose the sphere into rectangles,
 which I would not expect from a student who did work of his project's quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 his project makes use of spherical coordinates.
 According to Sarah Ziesler,
 this is already unusual for a student who got placed into MATH 152,
 but even more suspicious is the fact that he uses the following coordinates:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 It's unusual that a coordinate is dedicated for the radius,
 since the problem takes place on a sphere so a radial coordinate is unnecessary,
 but it's also surprising that he chose 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for the radial coordinate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three results upon searching 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spherical coordinates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on Google are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Wikipedia,
 which uses 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for radius but otherwise agrees with the student's conventions,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Paul's online notes,
 which uses 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for radius but otherwise has 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 swapped,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and Wolfram Mathworld,
 which both uses 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for the radial coordinate,
 and also has 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 the opposite way from the student.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these,
 only Paul's notes use 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for radius,
 and he does not discuss the area element.
 On the other hand,
 here is the output from ChatGPT upon inserting the Project prompt:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

While it still differs in terms of choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (which can be attributed to the fact that the problem statement is biased in that direction),
 the pattern (start with the coordinates and then immediately provide the area element with no justification (which they were supposed to do in the project...)) is very similar.
 Here is another iteration of ChatGPT's output:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This iteration uses 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

,
 but otherwise looks very similar to the student's solution in form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the project statement includes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

false solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 but it instructs the reader that they don't need to explain why it's incorrect.
 Nevertheless,
 ChatGPT reliably provided an explanation of why it is incorrect,
 and this student did as well:

 idea is incorrect.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Lastly,
 I note that the student referred to an incorrect argument as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

creative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In my experience,
 this is something that ChatGPT often does faced with incorrect material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my opinion,
 this is a strong case that this work was made with heavy use of ChatGPT,
 despite the student's claim that ChatGPT was used only to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explain the project's question
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will call the student over to my office,
 and ask him where he learned about spherical coordinates,
 and to explain them to me.
 I will ask him to explain how he figured out the area of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small spots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the student fails to provide a reasonable explanation,
 I will apply the following consequences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Report him to the Office of College Community Standards for further investigation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Count Project 3 as a 0,
 and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disallow Project 3 from counting as his lowest grade,
 leading in conjunction with the previous item to a deduction of 15% to his final grade.
