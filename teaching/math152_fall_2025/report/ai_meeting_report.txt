meeting reports:

audrey
claims to make sure she understands what she writes, but her understanding still matches the incorrect angle figure from the project
remove math points

motivation: was hard, didn't seem to connect to class content
suggestion: handout in P4 was good

jonathan
seems to check out. he has a reasonable source that used rho. though he did say that he wanted a figure and he has no figures in his project. but from my conversation with him i was unable to find any evidence that he used AI. he says he consulted a friend who knows multivariable. which i guess is fine. though he should give credit. i'll send him an e-mail saying that.


henry
"no, it just gave me steps as to how i should approach it, and then i put it split screen, it didn't give me the answers, it just told me for example what to plug in or some equations that i should do or something. it told me that i should use the circumference formula, for example."
"chatgpt gave me the circumference formula"

motivation: lost, didn't know how to get started
suggestion: one-on-one time with students to check in with them to see if they understand the project

agreed on 50% deduction on the project
(rethink this at the end....)

brendan
motivation: didn't feel well-equipped
suggestion: cover stuff more similar in class
