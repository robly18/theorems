Exam structure:

1. [10%] Integration Concepts
1a. [5%] A computational question regarding Riemann sums.
1b. [5%] A conceptual question regarding Riemann sums.

2. [20%] Applications of Integration
2a. [10%] Write the area of a shape in the plane as an integral in x and as an integral in y.
2b. [5%] Find a quantity given its rate of change and an initial value.
2c. [5%] Study a function defined via an integral.

3. [10%] Inverse Function Theorem
3a. [5%] Determine which functions among a family of functions are invertible.
3b. [5%] Study a function defined as the inverse of another.

4. [10%] Exponential Growth and Decay
4a. [5%] Apply the exponential model to describe a physical scenario and draw conclusions.
4b. [5%] Relate logarithms and exponentials of different bases.

5. [35%] Calculating Integrals
5a. [30%] For this section, I will randomly choose 6 integrals falling into the following categories, in the following quantities:
A. Immediate (0 to 1)
B. u-substitution (1 to 2)
C. by parts (1 to 2)
D. Multiple methods (1 to 2)
E. Uses a trick covered in class (double angle formula or trigonometric substitution) (1)
These integrals will be randomly sorted so that you cannot use their order as a hint as to the method of solution.
5b. [5%] One extra-tricky integral, with hints.

6. [5%] Differential Equations
6a. [5%] Solve a first-order linear differential equation

7. [10%] Miscellaneous
A few conceptual questions that do not fit into any of the above categories.

Study materials:
1. (5.2) 1-14, 19-21, 25-32. [Note: These exercises don't cover Left, Right, and Midpoint sums, but you are expected to know those as well.]
2. (6.1) All exercises up to 39.
3. (7.1) All exercises up to 52.
4. (7.5) 1-8, 19-35. (7.6) 3-13.
5. Assorted integrals at the start of exercises of chapters: 5.4, 5.5, 7.3, 7.4, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4. Some exercises may be outside the scope of the class. If you can't solve an exercise, let me know and the answer might be "don't worry, you don't need to know that".
6. (9.1) 7-28.
7. If you've studied for all the others, you'll be fine here.
