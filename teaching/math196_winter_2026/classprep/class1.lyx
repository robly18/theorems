\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
The textbook is important!
 There's a copy in the front page of Canvas.
 We'll be following it quite closely,
 and you should use it as a resource to study the materials.
 As such,
 I encourage you not to take notes too stringently if that's not helpful to you – the textbook has most of the material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
There is an Ed Discussion board where you may ask questions regarding the class and the class material,
 and will also serve as my means of communication on non-urgent business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
The last page of the syllabus has a rough calendar of what material will be covered in each class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Give out a copy of the first page of the syllabus to everyone.
 And give everyone a bit of time to read it and ask questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Pre-Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Introduce gestural notation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Hand to chest in a thumbs up:
 Affirmative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Hand to chest flat:
 Negative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Intermediate gestures for added nuance if necessary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Hand to chest in a fist:
 Failure mode,
 silent (e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

I don't know and don't want help)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Hand above shoulders in a fist:
 Failure mode,
 voiced (e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

Please repeat question,
 or I don't know and would like help,
 or I think something's wrong with the question)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Example questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout point
Did you understand the instructions?
\end_layout

\begin_layout point
Is this class going to be the first time you learn about linear algebra?
\end_layout

\begin_layout point
Do you usually ask questions in class (affirmative) or stay silent (negative)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout point
Do you use ChatGPT on a regular basis?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Elimination I
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Write a couple of linear systems in class and ask students if they know how to solve them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrr}
3x & + & 2y & = & 4\\
-x & + & 5y & = & -7
\end{array}\right.\qquad\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & + & 2y & + & 3z & = & 18\\
x & + & 3y & + & 2z & = & 17\\
3x & + & 2y & + & z & = & 22
\end{array}\right.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Introduce general linear system.
 Do some small variations (e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

put a square,
 or an 
\begin_inset Formula $xy$
\end_inset

,
 or numbers in the LHS or variables in the RHS) and gauge whether students think it's linear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Ask for how students would solve.
 Discuss briefly the two main ways:
 Substitution and Elimination.
 Focus of this class will be on Elimination,
 because it scales better and is foundational to LA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
The method of Elimination is also called:
 Gaussian Elimination,
 or Gauss-Jordan Elimination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
To solve a system by elimination,
 you're allowed to do the following three steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Swap two lines,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiply a line by a nonzero number,
 or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add a multiple of a line to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Do the above two systems as examples.
 Solutions:
 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,-1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(5,2,3)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Ask class if they feel capable of doing this on their own.
 If not,
 do another example:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & + & 2y & + & 3z & = & 8\\
x & + & 3y & + & 3z & = & 10\\
x & + & 2y & + & 4z & = & 9
\end{array}\right.\quad\text{Solution: \ensuremath{(1,2,1)}.}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Ask class,
 especially those who already knew this method,
 if they know 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 it works.
 Why are these operations 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

allowed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and not,
 say,
 squaring the coefficients of an equation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Bring up example of how squaring both sides of an equation isn't even a legal move:
 
\begin_inset Formula $x+1=2$
\end_inset

 has only one solution,
 but 
\begin_inset Formula $(x+1)^{2}=2^{2}$
\end_inset

 has two solutions!!!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
You're in this class to learn the math that works,
 but it's also important to understand 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 it works.
 In this class the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 won't be stressed as much as it would in a serious math course,
 but it's still sometimes vital in order to use this math productively and correctly,
 and absolutely necessary if you're going to create new methods that other people haven't thought of before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Extra credit opportunity:
 0.5% added to your final grade if you can satisfactorily explain why these three operations are legal.
 (This includes explaining 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 it means to say that an operation is legal!) See Canvas for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Another 0.5% if you can explain why these three operations are sufficient.
 This one is,
 I would say,
 a fair amount harder!
 It also includes explaining what it means for these operations to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sufficient
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 which is not as clear as it might at first seem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
These opportunities will be graded quite stringently!
 No partial credit.
 I must look at your submission and think,
 this is something that I as an undergrad would be able to read and understand and agree with.
 However,
 the due date is as late as Week 9,
 and you're welcome to re-submit as many times as you want,
 and discuss the problem and writing with me in Office Hours,
 in Ed,
 or via e-mail as many times as you need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
I recommend starting early,
 because this will be good practice for the projects,
 which will be graded very strongly on proper mathematical writing.
 But more on that next class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point

\series bold
Is this understood?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
We're going to be discussing the former question now,
 so you might want to pay attention if you want the extra credit.
 Note that my explanation is not going to be enough,
 in the sense that you cannot simply write down what I'm about to say and return a transcript to me.
 You must understand what I'm saying,
 in your bones,
 and you must be able to explain it again in your own way.
 An explanation on my part is only enough if you've gone and thought about it for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Ask students:
 What does it mean to say that an operation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

legal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
 (Expected answer:
 If something was a solution before,
 it's a solution now,
 and vice-versa.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Use example of 3-system to justify all three steps verbally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
In these cases,
 these operations are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that we can reach a new system whose solutions are very easy to read off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Elimination II
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Geometric interpretation of a system with 3 variables and 3 equations:
 Each equation represents a plane,
 to solve the system is to find the point at the intersection of all three planes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Are there any obvious questions that arise from this interpretation?
 (Expected answer:
 What if the three planes don't all cross at a point?
 Rebuttal:
 How could that happen?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Range of things that could happen:
 Two planes could be parallel,
 or two planes could coincide,
 or even though no two planes are parallel maybe they don't cross at a point.
 Draw examples of all cases you can think of (counting the usual one,
 I see 5 where all planes are distinct:
 point,
 line,
 parallel lines,
 Z,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\equiv$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Trick question:
 Does every (single) linear equation 
\begin_inset Formula $ax+by+cz=d$
\end_inset

 correspond to a plane in 3d?
 (No because 
\begin_inset Formula $0=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0=1$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Anyway,
 let's go back to the things that could happen geometrically and see how they happen in equations.
 Here is a system that corresponds to the parallel line case:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & + & 2y & + & 3z & = & 6\\
2x & + & 2y & + & 2z & = & 6\\
3x & + & 4y & + & 5z & = & 12
\end{array}\right.
\]

\end_inset

Do the elimination,
 get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & + &  & - & z & = & -3\\
 &  & y & + & 2z & = & 3\\
 &  &  &  & 0 & = & 0
\end{array}\right.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Meaning:
 What we're trying to find out is,
 what 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset

 can we plug in to make all of these equalities true?
 Well,
 the last one is true no matter what,
 so we only need to focus on the other ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
If you think about it,
 you can pick whatever value you want for 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 This value will then determine a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 that will make the equation true,
 and that value and only that value will work.
 Therefore,
 we have an infinitude of solutions,
 one for each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
We represent this infinitude of solutions as follows.
 We say that 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 and the general solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $(-3+z,3-2z,z)$
\end_inset

.
 This means that for every value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 that we plug in here we get a distinct solution,
 and every solution is obtained from plugging some value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Do the other two cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout point
Parallel lines is just changing,
 say,
 
\begin_inset Formula $12$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

,
 and now the last equation becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $0=-6$
\end_inset

,
 and no value of 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset

 that we plug into the system will possibly make this statement become true!
 So every tuple is immediately disqualified from being a solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout point
Z consists of replacing the LHS of the third equation by the LHS of (say) the first equation.
 Very quickly get 
\begin_inset Formula $0=6$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point

\series bold
Pause for questions.

\series default
 If students need more examples,
 see textbook.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point

\series bold
Important remark:

\series default
 For the case of three variables,
 this geometric intuition works fine,
 but the powerful thing is that it (and the methods) work in whatever number of variables!
 It's often a powerful idea to use the 3d case to think about the subject,
 but one must be aware that what we're doing works (or should work) for any number of variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Matrix Notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
It's convenient to abstract a bit from the way that we write systems.
 Carrying around the same variables all the time is kind of annoying and doesn't really add anything,
 especially since we always write them in the same place.
 Thus,
 we abstract away from the variable,
 and rewrite a system like
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & + & 2y & + & 3z & = & 18\\
x & + & 3y & + & 2z & = & 17\\
3x & + & 2y & + & z & = & 22
\end{array}\right.
\]

\end_inset

in what is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

augmented matrix notation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{rcrcrc|rc}
1 &  & 2 &  & 3 &  &  & 18\\
1 &  & 3 &  & 2 &  &  & 17\\
3 &  & 2 &  & 1 &  &  & 22
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
The vertical bar is only decoration (it's the namesake augmentation) – the underlying structure is called a 
\emph on
matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Definition:
 A matrix is a rectangular table whose entries are numbers.
 They are usually denoted in one of the following two ways:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}\text{ or }\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 2\\
3 & 5 & 8\\
-1 & -2 & -3
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
General matrix of width 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and height 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

,
 abbreviated to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (note that height then width!):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1m}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2m}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Note that the matrix is usually written with an upper-case letter,
 and its entries are written with the corresponding lower-case letter,
 with the subscript being two numbers:
 the row,
 then the column.
 Usually mathematicians juxtapose them,
 as in 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$
\end_inset

,
 but if this becomes ambiguous,
 you can write a comma to separate them,
 e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $a_{11,12}$
\end_inset

.
 This will not happen very often in this class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Do example of solving previous 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 system 
\series bold
with multiple solutions
\series default
 by using Gaussian Elimination on the corresponding Augmented Matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Go into detail on how to read off solution.
 Discuss pivots and pivot-free columns which correspond to free variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Elimination III
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Depending on time,
 do the following example with more or less detail:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrr}
2x_{1} & + & 4x_{2} & - & 2x_{3} & + & 2x_{4} & + & 4x_{5} & = & 2\\
x_{1} & + & 2x_{2} & - & x_{3} & + & 2x_{4} &  &  & = & 4\\
3x_{1} & + & 6x_{2} & - & 2x_{3} & + & x_{4} & + & 9x_{5} & = & 1\\
5x_{1} & + & 10x_{2} & - & 4x_{2} & + & 5x_{4} & + & 9x_{5} & = & 9
\end{array}\right.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Solution:
 (not easiest,
 swp12 first would be easier)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
2 & 4 & -2 & 2 & 4 & 2\\
1 & 2 & -1 & 2 & 0 & 4\\
3 & 6 & -2 & 1 & 9 & 1\\
5 & 10 & -4 & 5 & 9 & 9
\end{array}\right]\\
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
2 & 4 & -2 & 2 & 4 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3 & -2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 4
\end{array}\right]\\
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
2 & 4 & -2 & 2 & 4 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3 & -2\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3
\end{array}\right]\\
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
2 & 4 & -2 & 2 & 4 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 4 & -6\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3
\end{array}\right]\\
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
2 & 4 & -2 & 2 & 4 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 4 & -6\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Can already read off the solution if we want,
 but let's continue reducing,
 upward this time:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
1 & 2 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]\\
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr|r}
1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Point out pivots and free variables,
 read off solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

row-reduced matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

row-reduced echelon form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

echelon form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
 Every row is either zeros or starts with a single 1,
 called a pivot;
 every entry above a pivot is a zero,
 and the pivots are going 
\begin_inset Formula $\searrow$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
Recap Gauss-Jordan elimination:
 Apply the three elementary operations (swap two rows,
 multiply a row by a nonzero number,
 add a multiple of a row to another) to the matrix until it's in row reduced form.
 If there's a 
\begin_inset Formula $0=1$
\end_inset

 row,
 the system has no solution.
 Otherwise:
 The columns with no pivots are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free variables
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the columns with pivots are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

determined variables
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Introduce a parameter for each free variable,
 and for each determined variable,
 use the row it corresponds to to solve for this variable in terms of the free variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Point
You're going to do a lot of it in this course,
 so get used to it.
 The calculations will,
 for the most part,
 not be more complex than this last example.
