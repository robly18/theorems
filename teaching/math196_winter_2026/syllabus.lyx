Office Hours and E-mail
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Office hours are an opportunity for you to meet with me in person outside of class time and ask me questions.
 All questions are welcome – questions about homework assignments,
 material discussed in class,
 relations between concepts,
 etc.
 I will be scheduling three weekly hours of office hours sometime in Week 1,
 based on student responses to a poll to ensure that everyone can attend some office hour timeslot.
 It is your responsibility to fill out this poll to ensure that you are able to attend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a question that you feel does not warrant coming to meet me in person,
 you are welcome to contact me via e-mail (see above).
 I usually reply to e-mails within a few hours.
 However,
 I reserve the right to tell you that your question is too complex to deal with over e-mail,
 and invite you to attend office hours to discuss it in person.

\begin_layout Subsection
Course Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Math 19620 is a one-quarter course in linear algebra,
 intended primarily for students majoring in the social sciences.
 All fields of science use linearity as an assumption to approximate problems to facilitate the finding of solutions.
 Linear algebra is a mathematical tool that is just as fundamental as calculus.
 Topics includes systems of linear equations;
 linear transformations,
 matrices,
 determinants;
 linear (vector) spaces,
 bases,
 dimensions;
 orthogonality,
 the method of least squares;
 eigenvalues,
 eigenvectors and dynamical systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While much of the course is computational in nature,
 an emphasis will also be placed on conceptual understanding,
 logical reasoning and clear communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Course Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the end of the quarter you will be able to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
construct a valid and clearly articulated mathematical argument with appropriate use of mathematical logic and language;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
do your own research to learn a new mathematical concept,
 building on prior knowledge;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use a variety of strategies to determine solvability of linear equations and to find the solutions when they exist;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
demonstrate both an algebraic and a geometric understanding of linear transformation and their properties;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
apply fundamental concepts of matrices and linear transformations to solve problems,
 both in other areas of mathematics and in science (particularly in social science);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use the method of matrix diagonalization to solve problems about discrete dynamical systems that arise frequently in all areas of science.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Homework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problem sets will be assigned on a weekly basis,
 covering the material discussed in class in the previous week.
 Homework will be assigned on Thursday of every week and due a week after.
 The purpose of these problem sets is to ensure that you are keeping up with course material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lowest homework grade will be dropped.

Midterm Projects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There will be three projects during the course of this class.
 Collaboration is encouraged,
 as is asking for help in office hours,
 but nevertheless 
\series bold
these projects are intended to be solved individually.

\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the class after each project is due,
 there will be a 45-minute in-class quiz to ensure that each student has done their own project.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The midterm projects are intended to test your understanding of prior class material,
 your ability to research and apprehend novel material,
 and your ability to articulate proper and correct mathematical arguments to a diverse audience.
 They may require material not directly covered in class,
 but appropriate resources will be provided.
 Nevertheless,
 the material learned in the project will be considered to be covered,
 may be essential for subsequent classwork,
 and 
\series bold
will be tested in the final.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is the basic structure of these projects:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The student will be presented with correspondence from a fictional character who requires the student's assistance and mathematical expertise.
 The student is to write correspondence in response,
 with the intent of solving the correspondent's issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the end,
 I (the instructor) may pose some follow-up questions about the material the student has learned and how it relates to the class at hand.
 The student is to write an answer to these questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These projects will be graded largely on a metric that students may not have had much experience with before:
 proper mathematical communication.
 As such,
 there will be an optional assignment due one week prior to each project,
 called a Project Draft.
 These drafts will be graded like the final work,
 but their grade will not count for anything:
 They serve merely as a way for students to obtain feedback on their work prior to a final submission.

Midterm Project Quizzes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After each project is due,
 there will be a 45-minute quiz at the end of class to ensure that each student has done their own project.
 This quiz will consist of a small-scale version of the task that was done in the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This quiz will be graded on correct completion of the task (and work shown),
 not on communication.
 However,
 communicating your ideas properly with words and explanations can (in every evaluation,
 not just this one) lend your solution to greater partial credit,
 even if the calculations are not completely correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each midterm is worth 5% of the final grade,
 to a cap of 10%.
 Here are some examples of what this means:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the midterm grades are 100%,
 90%,
 80%,
 I will calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $100\%\times5\%+90\%\times5\%+80\%\times5\%=13.5\%$
\end_inset

,
 which adds 10% (the maximum) to your final grade,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the midterm grades are 40%,
 30%,
 and 50%,
 I will calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $40\%\times5\%+30\%\times5\%+50\%\times5\%=6\%$
\end_inset

,
 which adds 6% to your final grade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A student who gets a very poor result in the quiz will be called in for an oral examination regarding their work,
 as this may indicate a failure to do their own work in the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a rough idea of what your performance corresponds to in your midterm grade:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Task performed successfully with work shown 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 100%,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Task performed with minor errors and full work shown 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 90%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Task performed incorrectly with moderate work shown and confusingly explained 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 40%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Correct result but no work shown,
 or work shown which is incongruous with result obtained 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 0%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Late Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Submissions on projects or homework will be due at 23h59 of the respective day.
 Late submissions will be accepted,
 but will lose 1% of their grade for each 20 minutes late,
 as measured by the submission platform.
 Once corrections have been released for a given assignment,
 late submissions will cease to be accepted.
 For a sense of scale,
 here are some possible penalties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An assignment submit at 00h16 will suffer no penalty,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An assignment submit at 2h00 (121 minutes late) will suffer a penalty of 6%,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An assignment submit at 7h00 will suffer a penalty of 21%,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An assignment submit at 20h00 of the next day will suffer a penalty of 60%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example:
 an assignment submitted at 7h00 past the due date and whose nominal grade is 
\begin_inset Formula $98/100$
\end_inset

 will count in the student's final grade as if it had been worth 
\begin_inset Formula $98\times(100\%-21\%)=77.42$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to account for unexpected circumstances,
 every student will be given two free 24h extensions for Homework submissions on Gradescope.
 To claim your extension,
 you must send me an e-mail confirming in writing that you wish to use one of your extensions for a given homework within 24h of the due date.
 You may not claim two extensions for the same homework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please note that this policy (free extensions) does not apply to the midterm projects.

Collaboration Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a professional or academic setting,
 collaboration and teamwork is the norm.
 However,
 care must be taken to give proper credit:
 presenting someone else's ideas as though they were your own constitutes academic fraud.
 In accordance,
 collaboration is accepted for all assignments in this course unless indicated otherwise,
 but you should clearly state who your collaborators were and give credit where due.
 This also applies to help found from other online sources,
 e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

Stackoverflow,
 Wikipedia,
 etc.
 This also includes the usage of figures:
 A figure that is not of your own creation should be accompanied by a legend indicating where it was obtained.
 Regarding the usage of AI,
 see also the Generative AI Policy below.

Generative AI Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While generative AI (such as ChatGPT) can be a useful tool in many industries,
 over-using it can compromise your learning opportunities significantly.
 For example,
 if you use ChatGPT to do your homework for you,
 you will miss the opportunity to actually struggle with and understand the material.
 This will bode poorly for your chances on the final exam and future classes that require this material,
 and will also deprive you of valuable learning opportunities.
 It’s important to realize that:
 
\series bold
Reading and understanding an answer does not bring nearly the same learning benefits and struggling and solving a problem on your own or with others.

\series default
 As a consequence,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The use of generative AI is forbidden for projects in this course,
 and discouraged in other occasions.
 If you are suspected of using GenAI to do any portion of a project for you,
 including asking it to interpret the project statement or to read over your solution,
 you will be called in for an oral examination.
 
\series default
If you are deemed to have used GenAI in an inappropriate manner,
 you may be reprimanded;
 See Cheating Policy (

) below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Anything you'd like to ask AI you should instead ask your instructor,
 either at the end of class,
 in office hours,
 or via e-mail.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below are some examples of appropriate and inappropriate use of Generative AI in this course.
 Also keep in mind that Generative AI is notoriously unreliable and can sometimes produce weird and incorrect mathematical solutions;
 it may also favor tools or definitions that are outside the scope of this course.
 That is,
 treat any output from generative AI with healthy skepticism.

Cheating Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Cheating on homework or projects consists of copying someone else's work without attribution,
 or without understanding what you are writing.

\series default
 Notably,
 this includes the usage of Generative AI in this course;
 see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 If I suspect a student of having cheated in their homework or project,
 I may summon the student for a short oral examination.
 If I deem that a student has cheated on such an assignment,
 harsh penalties will be incurred,
 possibly including a null grade on the assignment,
 a flat penalty in the final grade,
 or a report to higher authorities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cheating on an exam is an extremely serious matter.
 I am the final arbiter of what counts as cheating or not.
 If you have any doubts about whether something constitutes cheating,
 ask me before doing it.
 If I catch you cheating on the exam,
 your exam grade will be severely penalized,
 and you will be reported to the University,
 leading to a mark on your academic transcript.

Electronics Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies have shown that the usage of electronics (tablets,
 computers,
 phones) is distracting to the user and to others.
 I will not stop you from making use of whatever electronics you please (so long as they do not disturb the rest of the class),
 but I do ask that if you will be using such a device for more than taking notes you should sit near the rear of the classroom.

Religious Accommodation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The University of Chicago is home to students of all the world’s major religions and,
 though firmly a secular institution,
 values the rich diversity of spiritual expression and practice found on campus.
 It is therefore the policy of the University that students who miss class,
 assignments,
 or exams to observe a religious holiday must be accommodated as follows:
 (i) absences may not be counted as a missed class in any course in which attendance is a measure of academic performance;
 (ii) reasonable extensions of time must be given,
 without academic penalty,
 for missed assignments;
 and (iii) exams must be reasonably rescheduled without academic penalty.
 Where a religious holiday occurs during the first week of the quarter,
 students who miss the first meeting of a class due to religious observance may not be dropped from the course roster,
 provided that they have given advance notice to the instructor of record of the need to miss the class due to a religious holiday.
