Exam structure:

Part I [40%] - General Linear Algebra
I will randomly select 4 of the following 6 exercise types, each worth 10%.
1. Use knowledge about the kernel and image of a matrix to deduce the number of solutions to an equation.
2. Given a linear subspace described by a spanning set, describe it via a basis and via Cartesian equations.
3. Invert a 3x3 matrix. Use the results to solve an equation.
4. Determine the dimension of a subspace described by Cartesian equations.
5. Sketch subspaces of R2 or R3 described in the following manner: By Cartesian equations, by a spanning set, as the image of a matrix, as the kernel of a matrix.
6. Compare subspaces of Rn. For example: Determine whether the kernel of a matrix is the same as the kernel of another.

Part II [20%] - Geometry
1. [5%] Interpret the determinant as one of: Measure of a shape, measure change factor of a linear transformation, test of invertibility, etc.
2. [5%] Formally manipulate the determinant, using rules such as det(AB)=detA detB, etc.
3. [5%] Interpret the dot product and use it to calculate geometrical quantities.
4. [5%] Formally manipulate the dot product, using it to draw conclusions about statements regarding orthogonality.

Part III [40%] - Diagonalization
1. [20%] Diagonalize a 3x3 matrix with repeated eigenvalues.
2. [20%] Interpret the results of diagonalization in the context of a discrete dynamical system, modeling some real-world phenomenon.


Part A: (General Linear Algebra)

Exercise 1: 

Exercise 2: Verify that a set of vectors forms a basis. Write a vector or transformation in that basis, or perform the opposite process. Interpret results.

Exercise 3: Some geometry using inner products and determinants.

Part B: (Spectral Theory)

Exercise 4: Diagonalize a 3x3 matrix with real eigenvalues, one of which is repeated.

Exercise 5: Interpret data given by the (complex) eigenvalues or eigenbasis of a matrix, in the context of a real-world problem (dynamical system, random walk, etc.). The matrix will be diagonalized for you if necessary.

Exercise 6: Conceptual questions about eigenvalues, eigenvectors, algebraic and geometric multiplicity, and geometric interpretation if applicable.


Here is where you may find practice exercises for each of these. All of the following numbers refer to Chapters from the textbook. A label "EOCX" refers to the exercises at the end of Chapter X. For each final exercise, I give a few chapters from the book, followed by a few selected exercises that catch my eye as good exam problems.
